Check it out on Marvel!Follow UX Power Tools on TwitterFollow me on TwitterModals, Overlays, Dialogs, whatever you call them it‚Äôs time to revisit this UI pattern. When they first came on the scene, modal windows were an elegant solution to a UI problem. The first being that it simplifies the UI, the second, it saves screen real estate. Since then designers have readily adopted the modal window and some have taken it to the extreme. Modals have become the today‚Äôs version of the dreaded popup window. Users find modals annoying and have been trained to instinctively and automatically dismiss these windows.A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application‚Äôs main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWikipediaYou may consider using a modal window when you need to:Use when you want to interrupt a user‚Äôs current task to catch the user‚Äôs full attention to something more important.Use when you want to get information from the user. Ex. sign up or login form.Use when you want to show additional information without losing the context of the parent page. Ex. showing larger images or videos.Use when you want to show information that is not directly related to the parent page or other options that are ‚Äúindependent‚Äù from other pages. Ex. notifications.Poorly implemented overlays can hinder task completion. To ensure your modal doesn‚Äôt get in the way make sure to include the following:Give users a way to escape by giving them a way to close the modal. This can be achieved in the following ways:Give context to the user with the modal title. This allows the user to know where he/she is because they haven‚Äôt left the original page.Button labels should have actionable, understandable names. This applies to a button in any instance. For modals, a ‚Äòclose‚Äô button should be present in the form of a labeled ‚Äòclose‚Äô button or an ‚Äòx‚Äô.A modal window should not be too big or too small, you want it juuuuust right. The goal is to keep context, therefore a modal should not take up the whole screen view. Content should fit the modal. If a scrollbar is needed, you may consider creating a new page instead.When you open a modal use a lightbox effect (darken the background). This draws attention to the modal and indicates that the user cannot interact with the parent page.Don‚Äôt surprise users by popping up a modal. Let a user‚Äôs action, such as a button click, following a link or selecting an option, trigger the modal. Uninvited modals may surprise the user and result in a quick dismissal of the window.Modals and mobile devices usually don‚Äôt play well together. Viewing the content is difficult because modals either are too large, taking up too much screen space or too small. Add in elements like the device keyboard and nested scrollbars; users are left pinching and zooming trying to catch the fields of a modal window. There are better alternatives for modals and shouldn‚Äôt be used on mobile devices.When creating modals remember to add in keyboard accessibility. Consider the following:Opening modal‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäThe element which triggers the dialog must be keyboard accessibleMoving focus into the Dialog‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOnce the modal window is open, the keyboard focus needs to be moved to the top of thatManaging Keyboard Focus‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOnce the focus is moved into the dialog, it should be ‚Äútrapped‚Äù inside it until the dialog is closed.Closing the Dialog‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäEach overlay window must have a keyboard accessible control to close that window.For more information on the list above check out Nomensa‚Äôs blog articleAccessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) defines ways to make Web content and Web applications more accessible.The following ARIA tags can be helpful in creating an accessible modal: Role = ‚Äúdialog‚Äù¬†, aria-hidden, aria-labelfor more information on ARIA, check out Smashing‚Äôs Magazine articleAlso, remember low-vision users. They may use screen magnifiers on monitors to enlarge the screen content. Once zoomed in the user can only see part of the screen. Here modals will have the same effect as they do in mobile.Getting the user‚Äôs attention, keeping context and simplifying the UI are great benefits of modals. However, there are downsides as they interrupt the user flow and make it impossible to interact with the parent page by hiding the content behind the modal. Modal may not always be the answer. Consider the following when making your choice:ChecklistThere is an alternative UI component to modals: non-modal or a.ka. toast (term used by Google in Material Design &amp; Microsoft).

Since then designers have readily adopted the modal window and some have taken it to the extreme. Modals have become the today‚Äôs version of the dreaded popup window. Users find modals annoying and have been trained to instinctively and automatically dismiss these windows.A modal window is an element that sits on top of an application‚Äôs main window. It creates a mode that disables the main window but keeps it visible with the modal window as a child window in front of it. Users must interact with the modal window before they can return to the parent application.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäWikipediaYou may consider using a modal window when you need to:Use when you want to interrupt a user‚Äôs current task to catch the user‚Äôs full attention to something more important.Use when you want to get information from the user.

I‚Äôm always looking to provide insightful info¬†:) And please recommend this article if you found it useful.Starting any project, which is not their personal presentation but a product for users, designers should be deeply aware: they work primarily not for self-expression, not for showing their creativity to the world, not for creating something revolutionary new that will make the world go round in opposite direction. They work to solve users‚Äô problems, satisfy their wishes and achieve business goals.That is why it‚Äôs vital to establish who the potential users of the future product are and which their wishes and needs could be met. This is the time when the designer turns into the researcher to get as much information as possible and analyze it for the sake of user-friendly solutions in design and interactions. In our earlier articles, we have already mentioned the significant role of user research in creating problem-solving user-friendly designs, and today we suggest getting deeper into its definition, methods, techniques and benefits in the process of creating a digital product.Generally, the word ¬´research¬ª, being quite universal for the diverse spheres of professional activities, roots into the Old French word recercher meaning ¬´seek out, search closely¬ª; first, it was the verb and later transformed into the noun of the same semantics. The modern definition of the noun according to Cambridge Dictionary state the meaning as ¬´a detailed study of a subject, especially in order to discover (new) information or reach a (new) understanding¬ª. This sort of activity is widely applied in a variety of sciences and practical fields, including informational architecture and user experience design.Basically, user research is the comprehensive and multilayered activity whose aim is to collect information about the potential target audience of the product. Via a number of techniques, user researchers collect and then analyze the information obtained from real users, and this outcome usually allows the design team to work on the optimal solutions which will make the product user-friendly and attractive.Therefore, user research means getting deeper into details of core target audience to understand their preferences and psychological peculiarities, the influence of different factors like colors, stylistic decisions, and logic of interaction on emotions and experience of the defined group, the sources of information and creative performance ways which could engage users and make them active. On this basis, visual design presumes to create the original and recognizable style that will make the product stand out of the crowd and draw potential customer‚Äôs attention.User research is actually the way by which designer is able to step into the shoes of the user and go along his or her path feeling all the stones on the way. This is the way to create designs based on empathy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe ability to place yourself onto the place of the other person, to feel what they are feeling and see what they are seeing. This precious ability enables designers to create things which not only work well and look good but also do what the particular users need them to do.Famous guru of advertising David Ogilvy emphasized the great importance of research for creating effective result: ¬´Advertising people who ignore research are as dangerous as generals who ignore decodes of enemy signals.¬ª Time has changed the means, goals and technologies, still, the vital role of research established even stronger. Neglecting the research stage and relying only on their creative intuition, experience and talent, designers risk failing this task as they will not know the conditions of the app functioning and will not be able to make it efficient, user-friendly and original.As we mentioned before, designers who start creating a product just at once when they get the task are quite risky guys. There are plenty of things to do before the designing process itself. Ignoring those things can give the interesting but not viable result. It‚Äôs important to analyze the competition, to understand the target market, to find out the sources of traffic and potential expectations of the users before setting off. Otherwise, you can waste much more time on loads of inefficient variants.Describing the typical stages of product creation process here in Tubik, we have mentioned the set of the following stages: setting the task and initial scope of works; estimation; user/market research; UX wireframing; prototyping; UI design; animation; software architecture planning; development; testing; release; updates. Still, it doesn‚Äôt mean that all these stages go one-by-one in this order‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome of them are interconnected and some of them are spread around the whole creative process. User research is applied at several different levels of creation, somehow changing the perspective and the goals on the data which should be obtained and analyzed.We would mark out three typical stages when user research is a must-do essential for creating the efficient design.Pre-design research: this is actually the initial stage of the creative process when designer working over the project is exploring the requirements of the stakeholders and collects the maximum information about the target audience. As well as in a scientific project, the scientist collects and analyzes the heritage of the previous specialists involved in the sphere to make the product actual, the UX designer needs to do the same to offer the solutions correspondent to what users need and want. This is the time to talk, read and analyze a lot. This is when the designer needs to dive into psychology and behavior, together with the stakeholder set the goals of the product and investigate the factors which influence choices in this domain. Certainly, with every next project and each next dose of experience, the designer can get accustomed to user research techniques and needs less time for them. However, there never comes the day when the designer doesn‚Äôt need any time for research as long as every project has its unique requirements and its own USP which should be enlightened by design.In-process research: it is applied at different stages of the actual design process when, having the chances to interact with users, discuss their wishes, watch their behavior and analyze the problems they have, designers explore the offered solutions in action and on that basis can alter some positions of their research and add more efficiency to the user interfaces.Real product research: this is the another level of research applied to actually existing digital product users operate with. Applying various techniques of user testing, designers collect actual experience, analyze it and make improvements in terms of real cases of the product usage in different environments and conditions.Certainly, there are numerous approaches to the process of research. Among them, we would like to draw your attention to the dimensions outlined by Nielsen Norman Group, highly experienced in the domain of research and analysis and regularly sharing their findings in this sphere. They offer to view the methods of user research along a 3-dimensional framework with the following axes:As we can see from the scheme, attitude is what people say while behavior is what people do. In real life, they are often different things and aspects, due to numerous reasons like individual traits of character, temper, education level, age, gender, beliefs and so on. Another opposition presents qualitative analysis, which is usually measured by definite numbers (like ¬´how many clicks the user makes before accomplishing the payment¬ª) and qualitative analysis (¬´why user can leave the page without registration and how this problem could be fixed¬ª). And the context of use analyzes all the additional factors which can influence the outcome of interaction with the product, for example, is the user goes along the preliminary given script or interaction is full improvisation.Analyzing the data in terms of different dimensions, designers are able to take the comprehensive outcome enabling to make solid decisions about the interactions and visual performance.Today, user experience design has already grown into a sphere with the considerable background of project and research cases, which have resulted in the extensive set of different research methods. Some methods are used on a regular basis, some are more rare and specific, yet it‚Äôs good for designers to be aware of a variety of them. Let‚Äôs briefly review the popular ones.Interviews. Perhaps the most widely spread method when, having set the target audience of the product, people involved into the creative process interact directly with potential users and ask them questions to collect information. The quality of questions is the issue of high importance here. It‚Äôs effective to apply both close (yes/no) and open (giving the detailed answer) questions to let users provide diverse information.Personas. The technique which has been applied in marketing and sales for a long time with client/buyer personas and now has transformed into a new perspective of user personas. With this technique, designer collects the data about the potential target audience, its psychological and behavioral preferences and habits and creates a bunch of imaginary users with these characteristic. On the ground of this data, the designer models users‚Äô interactions with the product and possible issues that can arise in the process.Sorting cards. This technique is effectively applied in cases when designers deal with the products presenting complex interfaces and variety of diverse content. The users are asked to categorize the content and set the hierarchies. In this way, the designers obtain the data showing how users see this sort of content and what way of its organization would be efficient for quick and easy navigation around the app or website.Surveys. Another traditional method of scientific and social explorations when users are offered the set of questions. Answering them, users give the actual information enabling designers to understand their preferences and wishes deeper.Focus group. Popular method presenting the moderated discussion of the product, its features, benefits and drawbacks within the group of people potentially close to the target audience. Altering some characteristics of the group, for example, age, gender, education level, tech literacy, researchers can receive the variety of data and see how these features can influence user behavior.Task analysis. The method exploring the tasks and goals which users have interacting with the product. Understanding what users want to do enables designer to consider the fast and effective ways to achieve these goals.Eyetracking. Special devices enable the designer to review which zones of the website or app users interact with more actively and use these zones in the most efficient and informative way.Participatory design. Users are offered the set of elements for the layout and can suggest their own vision of the construction.Clickstream testing. The analysis of the most clickable parts of the layout with the aim of designing clear interactions and reveal the problems.A/B Testing. The users deal with one variant of design (version A) for some time and then another variant (version B) while the researcher collects the information along the necessary metrics and makes the conclusion about the efficiency of the versions.Daily Reports. The user is asked to interact with a product for a particular period providing the reports on a daily basis. This helps to check the usability of the product in the perspective of long-term use.Desirability testing. The users are usually offered visually and stylistically different versions and provide the feedback which version they would prefer and why.Collecting the data about user behavior and preferences via diverse methods and techniques, the designer has to take into account the following factors:It‚Äôs should be remembered that removing the mistakes in design, even if its already high-fidelity level, is faster, cheaper and less painful for users than fixing negative issues with already launched and operating product.The bottom line is simple. Don‚Äôt be lazy to research vital points of the project before you start designing. Don‚Äôt fancy doing the research? No problem, go to duck and dive in loads of baseless concepts instead of going along the solid path of understanding the user‚Äôs needs and wishes. Just don‚Äôt forget: it‚Äôs not you who decides that the product is successful, it‚Äôs not even other designers or stakeholders. It‚Äôs users. So, empathy is the best policy.Here are some articles we recommend for those who would like to get deeper into the topic:Complete Beginner‚Äôs Guide to UX ResearchWhen to Use Which User-Experience Research MethodsUser Research BasicsPareto Principle-Based User ResearchHow To Conduct User Experience Research Like A ProfessionalOpen-Ended vs. Closed-Ended Questions in User ResearchOriginally written for tubikstudio.comWelcome to see the designs by Tubik Studio on Dribbble and BehanceWelcome to Tubik Blog"

    "contents": "Years ago I was driving back to Chicago from Wisconsin. On the Illinois side there are a couple of rest stops over the tollway. It‚Äôs a great place to get some gas, grab some caffeine, and stretch your legs a little before the final 50 miles home.The rest stop usually has a booth where you can buy a iPass so you don‚Äôt need to stop and pay tolls all the time. During the day there‚Äôs a person in the booth to help answer any questions you have.It appears that a lot of the same questions are asked over and over. Enough, in fact, that the person who answers them is sick of giving the same answer. That answer is ‚ÄúYes‚Äù.So they jumped on a computer somewhere and put together what I can only describe as one of the smartest formats for an FAQ I‚Äôve ever seen. A single answer on top, and all the questions below. The answer is always YES!! YES, YES. YES!! Then they taped it to the outside of the booth. You can‚Äôt miss it.I thought this was brilliant. I just love it. Yeah, it‚Äôs full of passive aggression and spelling errors and formatting problems, but the idea in itself is so refreshing. It‚Äôs folk information art.Inspired by this, we whipped up our own version of a YES! page for Basecamp 3. It was a fun exercise in messaging and design. We call it the YesAQ.Check it out.The only time I ever create ‚Äúreal‚Äù wireframes is when I‚Äôm trying to show a cool process shot on Dribbble‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I never show cool process shots on Dribbble.You guys, I‚Äôm just not good at wireframes!I always get excited and end up adding way too much detail, and what was supposed to be a quick wireframe ends up being six hours of nitpixeling‚Ñ¢ for perfect padding, magnificent margins, and textbook typography.So no‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not really that good at wireframes.But what I AM good at is blockframing.My design mentor told me a story about a professor he had in school who used to take his glasses off when he assessed their designs. He said it helped him get a better sense of the layout and visual harmony of their designs.Truth is, you can tell a pretty compelling story with this blurry mockup. It‚Äôs a quick way to vet a design without needing to design all that much.By identifying the largest regions of color above, here‚Äôs Facebook represented as a blockframe:With the amazing Auto Layout plugin by Anima App, I can even show you how the page content should behave when the browser is resized‚Ä¶what‚Äôs fixed‚Ä¶what‚Äôs fluid‚Ä¶and what‚Äôs floating:The advantage to blockframing is that you can do it during every phase of the product design process:Blockframing does not replace conventional wireframing. Wireframing just doesn‚Äôt fit into my workflow. My design team does so much collaboration on the whiteboard with the client that anything more than that is, for me, a waste of time.I personally find detailed wireframes with dummy text, one-pixel borders, and ‚ÄúX‚Äù placeholder images to be distracting. And if I find them distracting (as someone who knows how to read them), then the client might too.Using a blockframe, I describe entire areas of content instead of getting caught up in the details. This equips me with more than enough information to convey an idea or begin to tell a story.I‚Äôll usually send something like this to the client over Slack or email to quickly vet an idea for a new screen. We talk about the different areas, move things around, and start playing with color and contrast. It‚Äôs a great way to be agile and flexible with the design before diving into high-fidelity, and clients are always thrilled to be part of the process.This also saves time because the client won‚Äôt be splitting hairs over every little detail on the page. In my experience, blockframing with the client or stakeholder dramatically increases your success rate when showing off the final design(s) because the client already knows what‚Äôs coming.Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve already shipped the product and you‚Äôre on to designing new features. By this point, there are dozens of well-established patterns, and the visual style is very well defined. You might even have a full-blown design framework like UX Power Tools in place! üòâI find blockframing particularly useful during this phase because I can create something that will look much closer to the real design. The colors I use end up being pretty close (if not identical) to the ones in the final design.Here are a couple familiar apps that only took a few minutes to blockframe:I might do some light wireframing in addition to the blockframes shown above, but I‚Äôm otherwise ready to start designing in high-fidelity.Again, by this point in the process (mid-design), I‚Äôve already designed a bunch of screens and have lots of design patterns in place, so this is plenty of prep for me to get started. And chances are I‚Äôll just end up using these containers in the real design instead of throwing things away like I [often] do when I wireframe.At my agency, were always adjusting our client presentation techniques so that we‚Äôre showing off our work in the best way possible. After thousands of presentations, design reviews, and concept reveals with CEOs, investors, and heads of product, we‚Äôve gotten pretty good at telling the right story in the right way, at the right time.Once we finish a design, we create a blockframe directly on top of it so that we can slowly reveal different sections of the design. In our experience, showing the whole design all at once is SUPER OVERWHELMING for the client, and they‚Äôll start asking all kinds of questions that you‚Äôre not ready for.By blockframing over the UI, we‚Äôre essentially uncovering one dish at a time, as if we‚Äôre hosting a Victorian-era dinner party for our bourgeoise friends:Here‚Äôs how we would present YouTube:After doing a quick recap of the page regions, then we will start revealing the UI, section-by-section:We only show one section at a time. This helps us target the client‚Äôs attention to the one place we want them to focus:Let‚Äôs keep moving. Now we‚Äôre onto the video details. In this particular example, the page is pretty short. In a real scenario, we‚Äôd probably have a longer page to show off the comments section.Finally, we reach the ‚ÄúRelated Videos‚Äù and section. In a conversation with a client, we‚Äôd probably talk about how this list is populated, and how suggested videos like these will help to lead users into a BLACKHOLE OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS FOR THE NEXT FIVE HOURS.Not that that‚Äôs ever happened to me‚Ä¶Only after we‚Äôve finished revealing each section will we show off the whole interface:The client has been primed, and their eyes will instinctively compartmentalize each region of the page. They now have a perfect understanding of what each area of the page is for, and conversations from here on out will be much more productive. Clients will ask better questions, provide better feedback, and present the design (by themselves) to external stakeholders much more intelligently than before.Alright, alright.Auto Layout is an awesome tool, and their new ‚Äústacks‚Äù feature emulates CSS flexbox behaviors right inside of Sketch.It‚Äôs dope.You can get all 30+ layouts FUH FREE right down yonder. It will cost you zero dollars unless you want to fund a Chipotle burrito ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø(Related: Did you know there was a burrito emoji?

Otherwise, you can waste much more time on loads of inefficient variants.Describing the typical stages of product creation process here in Tubik, we have mentioned the set of the following stages: setting the task and initial scope of works; estimation; user/market research; UX wireframing; prototyping; UI design; animation; software architecture planning; development; testing; release; updates. Still, it doesn‚Äôt mean that all these stages go one-by-one in this order‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome of them are interconnected and some of them are spread around the whole creative process. User research is applied at several different levels of creation, somehow changing the perspective and the goals on the data which should be obtained and analyzed.We would mark out three typical stages when user research is a must-do essential for creating the efficient design.Pre-design research: this is actually the initial stage of the creative process when designer working over the project is exploring the requirements of the stakeholders and collects the maximum information about the target audience. As well as in a scientific project, the scientist collects and analyzes the heritage of the previous specialists involved in the sphere to make the product actual, the UX designer needs to do the same to offer the solutions correspondent to what users need and want. This is the time to talk, read and analyze a lot. This is when the designer needs to dive into psychology and behavior, together with the stakeholder set the goals of the product and investigate the factors which influence choices in this domain. Certainly, with every next project and each next dose of experience, the designer can get accustomed to user research techniques and needs less time for them. However, there never comes the day when the designer doesn‚Äôt need any time for research as long as every project has its unique requirements and its own USP which should be enlightened by design.In-process research: it is applied at different stages of the actual design process when, having the chances to interact with users, discuss their wishes, watch their behavior and analyze the problems they have, designers explore the offered solutions in action and on that basis can alter some positions of their research and add more efficiency to the user interfaces.Real product research: this is the another level of research applied to actually existing digital product users operate with. Applying various techniques of user testing, designers collect actual experience, analyze it and make improvements in terms of real cases of the product usage in different environments and conditions.Certainly, there are numerous approaches to the process of research. Among them, we would like to draw your attention to the dimensions outlined by Nielsen Norman Group, highly experienced in the domain of research and analysis and regularly sharing their findings in this sphere. They offer to view the methods of user research along a 3-dimensional framework with the following axes:As we can see from the scheme, attitude is what people say while behavior is what people do. In real life, they are often different things and aspects, due to numerous reasons like individual traits of character, temper, education level, age, gender, beliefs and so on. Another opposition presents qualitative analysis, which is usually measured by definite numbers (like ¬´how many clicks the user makes before accomplishing the payment¬ª) and qualitative analysis (¬´why user can leave the page without registration and how this problem could be fixed¬ª). And the context of use analyzes all the additional factors which can influence the outcome of interaction with the product, for example, is the user goes along the preliminary given script or interaction is full improvisation.Analyzing the data in terms of different dimensions, designers are able to take the comprehensive outcome enabling to make solid decisions about the interactions and visual performance.Today, user experience design has already grown into a sphere with the considerable background of project and research cases, which have resulted in the extensive set of different research methods. Some methods are used on a regular basis, some are more rare and specific, yet it‚Äôs good for designers to be aware of a variety of them. Let‚Äôs briefly review the popular ones.Interviews. Perhaps the most widely spread method when, having set the target audience of the product, people involved into the creative process interact directly with potential users and ask them questions to collect information. The quality of questions is the issue of high importance here. It‚Äôs effective to apply both close (yes/no) and open (giving the detailed answer) questions to let users provide diverse information.Personas. The technique which has been applied in marketing and sales for a long time with client/buyer personas and now has transformed into a new perspective of user personas. With this technique, designer collects the data about the potential target audience, its psychological and behavioral preferences and habits and creates a bunch of imaginary users with these characteristic. On the ground of this data, the designer models users‚Äô interactions with the product and possible issues that can arise in the process.Sorting cards. This technique is effectively applied in cases when designers deal with the products presenting complex interfaces and variety of diverse content. The users are asked to categorize the content and set the hierarchies. In this way, the designers obtain the data showing how users see this sort of content and what way of its organization would be efficient for quick and easy navigation around the app or website.Surveys. Another traditional method of scientific and social explorations when users are offered the set of questions. Answering them, users give the actual information enabling designers to understand their preferences and wishes deeper.Focus group. Popular method presenting the moderated discussion of the product, its features, benefits and drawbacks within the group of people potentially close to the target audience. Altering some characteristics of the group, for example, age, gender, education level, tech literacy, researchers can receive the variety of data and see how these features can influence user behavior.Task analysis. The method exploring the tasks and goals which users have interacting with the product. Understanding what users want to do enables designer to consider the fast and effective ways to achieve these goals.Eyetracking. Special devices enable the designer to review which zones of the website or app users interact with more actively and use these zones in the most efficient and informative way.Participatory design. Users are offered the set of elements for the layout and can suggest their own vision of the construction.Clickstream testing. The analysis of the most clickable parts of the layout with the aim of designing clear interactions and reveal the problems.A/B Testing. The users deal with one variant of design (version A) for some time and then another variant (version B) while the researcher collects the information along the necessary metrics and makes the conclusion about the efficiency of the versions.Daily Reports. The user is asked to interact with a product for a particular period providing the reports on a daily basis. This helps to check the usability of the product in the perspective of long-term use.Desirability testing. The users are usually offered visually and stylistically different versions and provide the feedback which version they would prefer and why.Collecting the data about user behavior and preferences via diverse methods and techniques, the designer has to take into account the following factors:It‚Äôs should be remembered that removing the mistakes in design, even if its already high-fidelity level, is faster, cheaper and less painful for users than fixing negative issues with already launched and operating product.The bottom line is simple. Don‚Äôt be lazy to research vital points of the project before you start designing. Don‚Äôt fancy doing the research? No problem, go to duck and dive in loads of baseless concepts instead of going along the solid path of understanding the user‚Äôs needs and wishes. Just don‚Äôt forget: it‚Äôs not you who decides that the product is successful, it‚Äôs not even other designers or stakeholders. It‚Äôs users. So, empathy is the best policy.Here are some articles we recommend for those who would like to get deeper into the topic:Complete Beginner‚Äôs Guide to UX ResearchWhen to Use Which User-Experience Research MethodsUser Research BasicsPareto Principle-Based User ResearchHow To Conduct User Experience Research Like A ProfessionalOpen-Ended vs. Closed-Ended Questions in User ResearchOriginally written for tubikstudio.comWelcome to see the designs by Tubik Studio on Dribbble and BehanceWelcome to Tubik BlogThe card is a user interface component that acts as an entry point to more detailed information. Varying sources of information are pooled together and presented in a digestible way. It is a reflection of our current media environment.The proliferation of varying screen dimensions and the launch of HTML5/CSS3 around the turn of the decade enabled the card to take shape. It was the perfect representative of the new web, where social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Pinterest launched into the mainstream. The web saw greater personalization, aggregation, and socialization than ever before. And the card was its container.Cards accommodated fleeting micro-posts, serving singular thoughts, ideas, and most importantly pictures to an audience with a shorter attention span than a goldfish.Cards present various content pieces in a group. The viewer attains a quick overview of information and has the option to see its entirety.The information between cards is of equal hierarchy. This allows the user to browse content in a manner similar to surveying a store shelf. Users evaluate each card before committing to action.Cards work well for responsive web design because of their flexibility. Through the use of media queries, content can be reordered to fit any screen. This malleability enables a visual language and user experience to be unified across devise types.To design better cards you must understand its comprising elements. Cards may include a headline, sub-headline, summary text, multi-media, image, video, graph, comments, and action. Actions are usually limited, and in many cases the entire card serves as a singular link.Cards are presented in many ways including individually, in a timeline, gallery, next to each other, or making up a dashboard.The card currently symbolizes the height of a fragmented societal consciousness alienated from its humanity, and desperately searching for meaning. The result is a condition where addiction loops dictate how media is consumed. Vapid blips are on constant rotation, pedaling the emotions of arousal to direct attention towards what the content manipulator, advertiser, and siren server wants us to see. Joy, happiness, anger, frustration, hate, and excitement are offered as a way to temporarily distract us from our reality and greater potential to change it.This spectacle will change when designers and engineers push back on the linear trajectory of the web and direct it toward the reality we wish to bring into existence.In the future, the card will symbolize the entry point to a culture with a sense of purpose and self-esteem, and the exodus from fragmented culture wars, nihilism, institutional decay, and thoughtless consumption.The wealth or poverty of our web is up for us to decide. The card is just its container. I hope this article helps you design it better.Find me on Twitter."
