    "contents": "I decided to lose weight after my ex-wife cheated on me stating that she found me unattractive, that she never loved me and that she was leaving and taking the dog with her. This personal narrative drove me to lose over 100lbs in 6 months and maintain that weight loss for over a year now. Emotional pain is an effective catalyst for change.I started eating 1,200 calories/day.Weight loss is pretty simple when you get down to it: Calories In - Calories Out = Weight Change. “Calories out” are a combination of TDEE (at-rest daily caloric expenditure), exercise and metabolism, while “calories in” are solely impacted by what you eat. The most accurate math I’ve seen shows that a 3,555 caloric deficit leads to the loss of 1lb of body fat.As an engineer-at-heart the decision seemed straight-forward: cut caloric intake beyond any healthy limit so I could lose the weight I wanted. As a 5&#39;6&quot; 275lbs male, I would need to consume 3,000+ calories daily to maintain my current weight. According to my calculations, If I reduced my daily caloric intake to 1,200 calories/day I would experience a 3lbs a week weight lose. Well, that’s what I did and that’s the rough average I got.At this point I should say that I’m not a healthcare professional and I’m not recommending my dietary changes to anyone. I was in intense emotional pain every single day and made the decision to capitalise on it.The day after my ex-wife dumped me I joined a gym, got a personal trainer and started working out 3–5 times each week. I am incredibly lucky that I joined a supportive gym and found my personal trainer Dan Valenzuela and now Chris Arriola.Exercise on its own doesn’t really move the needle directly when it comes to weight loss. An hour of resistance training adds less than 300 calories to the “Calories Out” column. Not eating that burrito is a 600 calories reduction of “Calories In”. Easy math.So why did I focus aggressively on exercise? As soon as you cut caloric intake the human body starts lowering metabolism which in turn reduces your at-rest calories out. Exercise keeps metabolism up and helped me avoid metabolic reduction. Also, the more weight I lost, the more important caloric expenditure from exercise became as my recommended caloric intake dropped. Lastly, building muscle helps fill-in some of the loose skin that comes with extreme weight loss.And man, do I love flexing my biceps nowadays :)The month before I started my diet I walked an average of 4,000 steps each day. The #1 advice health professionals have on the numerical aspect of step count is: do more. However many steps you’re walking daily, do more. The 10,000 steps/day number you might have heard is a “recommendation” because that’s a bit more then most of us do regularly. The real trick is to having walking actively support your weight loss is to just increase your daily step count.So I walked more than 4,000 steps/day. I increased my daily step count to 16,000 steps/day. I got a fitbit and made my daily walk a part of my spiritual practice. There’s some research behind that people who walk a lot persist less with their exercise than joggers/runners do. So it’s even more important for walkers to find a schedule and stick to it.I decided I’d only be eating a single “meal” every day. No breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. It was fairly easy due to a combination of low-grade depression that reduced my appetite and having fairly immense energy stores in the form of fat. My chosen meal was a salad for lunch. Every day for lunch for the last 18 months I’ve had a salad that accounted for about 50% of my daily caloric intake.On a low caloric diet it’s super important to find snacks that hit the perfect trifecta:So what are my go-to snacks?I started taking recreational culinary &amp; pastry classes once a week at San Francisco Cooking school. Class topics ranged from basic knife skills, roasting a chicken, making pho, deep-frying donuts, whipping up marshmallows, baking pies and more. Spending well over 200 hours in culinary &amp; pastry classes has radically changed my relationship with food. Having a new appreciation of flavor, texture, history and technique has brought food into focus every time I eat.After attending so many recreational culinary classes I decided to join the part-time professional culinary program at the same school. This is on top of my full-time career. I feel lucky to be equally passionate about both my culinary interest and my career. I’m two months into a year long culinary program and it has already positively impacted my expectations of food. Instead of mindlessly filling myself of the same old meat &amp; potatoes diet, I now eat new, exciting and unfamiliar cuisine every week.Culinary school also has an interesting dietary impact of upcycling my caloric intake on a weekly basis. I’m sure that helped with my low-calorie diet. Where most days I’d eat 1,200 calories/day, having one day each week at 3,000+ calories/day helped keep my metabolism going."

There, he discovered an unexpected morning meal he liked so much that he’s been enjoying it ever since: oatmeal made with veggie stock, eggs, miso paste, green onion, bonito flakes and togarashi, a hot-pepper blend with citrus peel and garlic.If you’re more likely to reach for fruits and brown sugar than eggs and onion to top your oatmeal, you’re missing out on a whole other world of tasty and nutritious oats recipes like Potilskis’ Japanese-inspired dish.Oats are popular because they’re a “blank canvas” for a nutritious and satisfying morning meal, says registered dietitian Bonnie Taub-Dix. They’re also the whole-grain source with the highest amount of soluble fiber, said Jodee Johnson, an associate principal scientist for Quaker Oats and member of the Quaker Nutrition Sciences team that researches the nutritional benefits of oats.But nutritionists say adding savory ingredients such as veggies, fish, meat, cheese or eggs to your oats is an easy — and surprising — way to get the balance of protein, carbs, fiber and fat that you need in your first meal of the day.Let’s look at some delicious ways to add savory oats to your morning routine, depending on your breakfast personality.Making savory oats doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, you can whip up a nutritious batch using ingredients you have in your fridge and pantry.Alycia Hammersmith, a health coach at a digital startup, says knowing that she can spice up her oats with readily available ingredients has helped her adopt and maintain healthy eating habits in the mornings. “It’s saved me from many sugar-laden breakfasts,” she says. The switch allows her to easily whip up her current favorite savory starter: oats, a fried egg and whatever greens are in the fridge.If you want to have fun with your breakfast, the possibilities are endless with savory oats.For an Asian-inspired twist, consider adding oats to the ingredients you’d normally find in a noodle- or rice-based dish. To start, swap water for a low-sodium veggie, chicken or beef broth as your oatmeal’s liquid base. Then add protein, such as eggs, cheese, tofu or lean meats, and vegetables of your choice. Try topping your meal with different condiments — think miso, white pepper or hot sauce — to up the umami. Finally, add olive oil, coconut oil or flaxseed oil to bolster the satisfying, full feeling that oats provide.Entrepreneur Erin Borges balances sweet peach oatmeal with Brie, basil and bacon. Blake Moore, a marketing strategist, uses oats as a “grain bed” for salmon, kimchi, sautéed mushrooms, zucchini, kale and seaweed, and his “breakfast curry” combines oatmeal with eggs and red or green curry paste. Chef and culinary consultant Jenny Dorsey makes Tunisian-style oatmeal with tomato, parsley, olive oil, scallions and harissa, a North African spice blend.With savory oats, you don’t have to choose between flavor and speed. You can cook Quaker Instant Oatmeal in just 90 seconds in the microwave, and try preparing Quaker Old Fashioned Oats the night before to create chilled Overnight Oats that are ready to grab and go in the morning — add water, milk or yogurt to oats and your desired toppings in an airtight glass jar and let sit overnight. (Tip: With only a few minutes of chopping at the beginning of the week, you can package each day’s savory toppings ahead of time.)If the thought of morning mixing still feels like a stretch, set aside time to make a large batch of your favorite recipe on the weekend, freeze it in small containers and reheat some in the mornings.Adding savory ingredients to your oats is a great way to shake up your breakfast routine with exciting new food combinations and give both your mind and your body the sustenance they need.Looking for even more inspiration to spice up your mornings with savory oats?

You know? They seem completely redundant given the invention of hosing down anyone who knocks on the front door, which is what I prefer doing. There might be a downside, of course. It might put me in a position where I need to mollify the surprised and uninitiated. But since I insist that people take their shoes off before they come inside anyway then the trade-off more than makes up for it, since their water-soaked socked feet serve to keep my floors well mopped. It’s been even more effective since I started adding Murphy’s Oil Soap to my “Welcome all comers” spray-down, leaving all my guests fragrant and freshly laundered for their social evening out.Just one of my little workarounds that make the labyrinth of adult life a little easier.Because that’s the real problem, isn’t it? Being a “grownup” — whatever those are — becomes this unmitigated requirement. “Grownups” are a band of incompetents, screwing up the world order at every level, and bumbling around alternately expanding out of their clothes and surprising themselves out of naps with their snores, and dictating short-sighted changes in world order to support their goals for comfier shoes and food that plays less havoc with their stomach juices.And yet their fumbling fellowship comes for all of us someday, gifting us with weight gain and hair loss and “responsibility” without so much as a, “thanks for your contribution — here’s your membership card.”They’re a sluggish, cautious species, more inclined to cough than groan and more inclined to groan than laugh, whose semi-permeable membranous definitions continuously encroach on all of the rest of us. One day we’re curing last night’s hangover and the worst headache of our life by planning how we’ll spend tonight punching ourselves in the face, and on the next day we’re getting a similar headache from choosing between two existentially identical laminated end tables and discovering that every headache we had ever experienced before barely deserved to be called pain.That’s the cruelty of the world, you see.There is a saying, I don’t know where it’s from really, that has come to be popular recently. Maybe you’ve seen it. It says: Age is mandatory — maturity is optional. Which is true, and in some cases manifestly conceived like an inalienable right.The problem with it is, maturity might be only an optional feature of life, but the weird science of “grown up responsibilities” — whatever that means — encroaches upon you whether you continue with the strict policy that your brain is made of cheese or not.I don’t have to be mature. Of course I don’t. I can whine and pout and maintain a whimsical understanding of reality for as long as I like. I probably will.The problem I have is, “I never got the memo…so…nah, I don’t feel like it,” does not appear to be a permissible argument in casual tax dodging. Young adults struggle to even find which ends are in question, and can’t even bring those ends within a hundred leagues of each other, let alone make them meet. I think the reason that “kids these days,” whoever they are, have a reputation for being sex crazed because when they hear “grownups” talk about making ends meet that what they really mean is the ends involved in visiting the recumbent discotheque.I don’t know what you call it. That’s what I call it.I have rarely, if ever, seen documentary evidence of the IRS responding to the young, confused, hungover and sore young people, with a genial clap on the shoulder and an assurance that at the next “grownup club” meeting that all would be made clear.That’s really what it feels like. There is this club, where they keep the best booze and the comfiest chairs and all the keys to paradise, and all you need to get in unlock the mystic secrets of Home Making to get in. And the secret to unlocking the secrets is at the end of an invisible, seven part maze, outlined by the initiated in Costco, Lowes, and Bed Bath and Beyond.Am I alone in this? Is there a secret Rite of Initiation to get into The Right and Ancient Society of Adult, where there are instruction manuals that explain things like, you know, how to grocery shop and include vegetables? Because grownups always seem to have vegetables.And when I say vegetables, I mean real vegetables — carrots and lettuce and things. Not that green slop that your vegetables turn into at the bottom of the refrigerator two days after you come home from the grocery store. Proper vegetables. You know what I mean by that: You went to the store and bought basil and cilantro and spinach, feeling palpable dreams for the weekend and all the compliments about how you’re a real person and not a half-formed Caliban who fills out that corner of the food triangle with Jalapeno poppers. You considered the kale — of course you did — you hear it’s hip. But you decided on spinach. Keep it classic, you thought. Keep it classic.Then the day comes. Your peers are there, unsure what to do with their elbows or the hand not holding the beer. The look of concentration on their faces bespeaks that’s the main thing on their mind. You reach into the fridge drawer — cool and nonchalant — and say in an offhand way to your eager guests, “I’ll just make a salad, shall I?”Then your hand squelches on the ooze that replaced your vegetables. You immediately squash the thought, “I wish I had bought those four turtles I saw yesterday…” to save it for later. There is a time and a place for Splinter fantasies, and the struggle to maintain the illusion of competence during a “Grownup Ritual” is not one of them.Then you slam the fridge closed and get out the jalapeno poppers.That’s last weekend.Thing is, I feel like my parents always had access to salad. You could move for the stuff. There was miles of it. You’d think that they had it falling out their ears. I never even SAW them eat jalapeno poppers. Or oven-baked french fries. Tater tots were a special treat. They didn’t have any of these tepid variations on vegetables I find that I keep around because they seem to be the only thing hearty enough to withstand the force of my unfiltered glaring, because I can’t figure out what else it is that’s liquefying every natural substance in my fridge. Leftovers seem to be going bad constantly in there. I can’t keep a gallon of milk alive without intense life support. And I’ve started to charge the colony that was cheese rent, seeing as it hogs the wifi.I admit, those last items are probably my fault.I don’t know. It’s all confusing. Budget management. Grocery shopping. Adult social swim, when we go to the bar for half an hour, bitch about getting up too early and never having any fun, then go to bed at 9:30 to repeat the same old drudgery, and finding some meaning in that cycle. There’s got to be a Grownup Book of Laws or some classes or something that I missed somewhere.A lot of this makes no sense. If there isn’t something I missed, and this stumbling around like I’m being forced to wear a bag over my head while completing puzzles on top of a termite colony is “normal,” then life is a lot more peculiar than even I think, and I spend serious time thinking about gluons.Dispatches from the Adventure (Exclusive “news-lite” letter).Follow the Adventure (Patreon profile.

Well, that’s what I did and that’s the rough average I got.At this point I should say that I’m not a healthcare professional and I’m not recommending my dietary changes to anyone. I was in intense emotional pain every single day and made the decision to capitalise on it.The day after my ex-wife dumped me I joined a gym, got a personal trainer and started working out 3–5 times each week. I am incredibly lucky that I joined a supportive gym and found my personal trainer Dan Valenzuela and now Chris Arriola.Exercise on its own doesn’t really move the needle directly when it comes to weight loss. An hour of resistance training adds less than 300 calories to the “Calories Out” column. Not eating that burrito is a 600 calories reduction of “Calories In”. Easy math.So why did I focus aggressively on exercise? As soon as you cut caloric intake the human body starts lowering metabolism which in turn reduces your at-rest calories out. Exercise keeps metabolism up and helped me avoid metabolic reduction. Also, the more weight I lost, the more important caloric expenditure from exercise became as my recommended caloric intake dropped. Lastly, building muscle helps fill-in some of the loose skin that comes with extreme weight loss.And man, do I love flexing my biceps nowadays :)The month before I started my diet I walked an average of 4,000 steps each day. The #1 advice health professionals have on the numerical aspect of step count is: do more. However many steps you’re walking daily, do more. The 10,000 steps/day number you might have heard is a “recommendation” because that’s a bit more then most of us do regularly. The real trick is to having walking actively support your weight loss is to just increase your daily step count.So I walked more than 4,000 steps/day. I increased my daily step count to 16,000 steps/day. I got a fitbit and made my daily walk a part of my spiritual practice. There’s some research behind that people who walk a lot persist less with their exercise than joggers/runners do. So it’s even more important for walkers to find a schedule and stick to it.I decided I’d only be eating a single “meal” every day. No breakfast, lunch and dinner for me. It was fairly easy due to a combination of low-grade depression that reduced my appetite and having fairly immense energy stores in the form of fat. My chosen meal was a salad for lunch. Every day for lunch for the last 18 months I’ve had a salad that accounted for about 50% of my daily caloric intake.On a low caloric diet it’s super important to find snacks that hit the perfect trifecta:So what are my go-to snacks?I started taking recreational culinary &amp; pastry classes once a week at San Francisco Cooking school. Class topics ranged from basic knife skills, roasting a chicken, making pho, deep-frying donuts, whipping up marshmallows, baking pies and more. Spending well over 200 hours in culinary &amp; pastry classes has radically changed my relationship with food. Having a new appreciation of flavor, texture, history and technique has brought food into focus every time I eat.After attending so many recreational culinary classes I decided to join the part-time professional culinary program at the same school. This is on top of my full-time career. I feel lucky to be equally passionate about both my culinary interest and my career. I’m two months into a year long culinary program and it has already positively impacted my expectations of food. Instead of mindlessly filling myself of the same old meat &amp; potatoes diet, I now eat new, exciting and unfamiliar cuisine every week.Culinary school also has an interesting dietary impact of upcycling my caloric intake on a weekly basis. I’m sure that helped with my low-calorie diet. Where most days I’d eat 1,200 calories/day, having one day each week at 3,000+ calories/day helped keep my metabolism going.Alon Potilskis was never a big breakfast eater — until he went to Japan. There, he discovered an unexpected morning meal he liked so much that he’s been enjoying it ever since: oatmeal made with veggie stock, eggs, miso paste, green onion, bonito flakes and togarashi, a hot-pepper blend with citrus peel and garlic.If you’re more likely to reach for fruits and brown sugar than eggs and onion to top your oatmeal, you’re missing out on a whole other world of tasty and nutritious oats recipes like Potilskis’ Japanese-inspired dish.Oats are popular because they’re a “blank canvas” for a nutritious and satisfying morning meal, says registered dietitian Bonnie Taub-Dix. They’re also the whole-grain source with the highest amount of soluble fiber, said Jodee Johnson, an associate principal scientist for Quaker Oats and member of the Quaker Nutrition Sciences team that researches the nutritional benefits of oats.But nutritionists say adding savory ingredients such as veggies, fish, meat, cheese or eggs to your oats is an easy — and surprising — way to get the balance of protein, carbs, fiber and fat that you need in your first meal of the day.Let’s look at some delicious ways to add savory oats to your morning routine, depending on your breakfast personality.Making savory oats doesn’t have to be complicated. In fact, you can whip up a nutritious batch using ingredients you have in your fridge and pantry.Alycia Hammersmith, a health coach at a digital startup, says knowing that she can spice up her oats with readily available ingredients has helped her adopt and maintain healthy eating habits in the mornings. “It’s saved me from many sugar-laden breakfasts,” she says. The switch allows her to easily whip up her current favorite savory starter: oats, a fried egg and whatever greens are in the fridge.If you want to have fun with your breakfast, the possibilities are endless with savory oats.For an Asian-inspired twist, consider adding oats to the ingredients you’d normally find in a noodle- or rice-based dish. To start, swap water for a low-sodium veggie, chicken or beef broth as your oatmeal’s liquid base. Then add protein, such as eggs, cheese, tofu or lean meats, and vegetables of your choice. Try topping your meal with different condiments — think miso, white pepper or hot sauce — to up the umami. Finally, add olive oil, coconut oil or flaxseed oil to bolster the satisfying, full feeling that oats provide.Entrepreneur Erin Borges balances sweet peach oatmeal with Brie, basil and bacon. Blake Moore, a marketing strategist, uses oats as a “grain bed” for salmon, kimchi, sautéed mushrooms, zucchini, kale and seaweed, and his “breakfast curry” combines oatmeal with eggs and red or green curry paste. Chef and culinary consultant Jenny Dorsey makes Tunisian-style oatmeal with tomato, parsley, olive oil, scallions and harissa, a North African spice blend.With savory oats, you don’t have to choose between flavor and speed. You can cook Quaker Instant Oatmeal in just 90 seconds in the microwave, and try preparing Quaker Old Fashioned Oats the night before to create chilled Overnight Oats that are ready to grab and go in the morning — add water, milk or yogurt to oats and your desired toppings in an airtight glass jar and let sit overnight. (Tip: With only a few minutes of chopping at the beginning of the week, you can package each day’s savory toppings ahead of time.)If the thought of morning mixing still feels like a stretch, set aside time to make a large batch of your favorite recipe on the weekend, freeze it in small containers and reheat some in the mornings.Adding savory ingredients to your oats is a great way to shake up your breakfast routine with exciting new food combinations and give both your mind and your body the sustenance they need.Looking for even more inspiration to spice up your mornings with savory oats?

You know? They seem completely redundant given the invention of hosing down anyone who knocks on the front door, which is what I prefer doing. There might be a downside, of course. It might put me in a position where I need to mollify the surprised and uninitiated. But since I insist that people take their shoes off before they come inside anyway then the trade-off more than makes up for it, since their water-soaked socked feet serve to keep my floors well mopped. It’s been even more effective since I started adding Murphy’s Oil Soap to my “Welcome all comers” spray-down, leaving all my guests fragrant and freshly laundered for their social evening out.Just one of my little workarounds that make the labyrinth of adult life a little easier.Because that’s the real problem, isn’t it? Being a “grownup” — whatever those are — becomes this unmitigated requirement. “Grownups” are a band of incompetents, screwing up the world order at every level, and bumbling around alternately expanding out of their clothes and surprising themselves out of naps with their snores, and dictating short-sighted changes in world order to support their goals for comfier shoes and food that plays less havoc with their stomach juices.And yet their fumbling fellowship comes for all of us someday, gifting us with weight gain and hair loss and “responsibility” without so much as a, “thanks for your contribution — here’s your membership card.”They’re a sluggish, cautious species, more inclined to cough than groan and more inclined to groan than laugh, whose semi-permeable membranous definitions continuously encroach on all of the rest of us. One day we’re curing last night’s hangover and the worst headache of our life by planning how we’ll spend tonight punching ourselves in the face, and on the next day we’re getting a similar headache from choosing between two existentially identical laminated end tables and discovering that every headache we had ever experienced before barely deserved to be called pain.That’s the cruelty of the world, you see.There is a saying, I don’t know where it’s from really, that has come to be popular recently. Maybe you’ve seen it. It says: Age is mandatory — maturity is optional. Which is true, and in some cases manifestly conceived like an inalienable right.The problem with it is, maturity might be only an optional feature of life, but the weird science of “grown up responsibilities” — whatever that means — encroaches upon you whether you continue with the strict policy that your brain is made of cheese or not.I don’t have to be mature. Of course I don’t. I can whine and pout and maintain a whimsical understanding of reality for as long as I like. I probably will.The problem I have is, “I never got the memo…so…nah, I don’t feel like it,” does not appear to be a permissible argument in casual tax dodging. Young adults struggle to even find which ends are in question, and can’t even bring those ends within a hundred leagues of each other, let alone make them meet. I think the reason that “kids these days,” whoever they are, have a reputation for being sex crazed because when they hear “grownups” talk about making ends meet that what they really mean is the ends involved in visiting the recumbent discotheque.I don’t know what you call it. That’s what I call it.I have rarely, if ever, seen documentary evidence of the IRS responding to the young, confused, hungover and sore young people, with a genial clap on the shoulder and an assurance that at the next “grownup club” meeting that all would be made clear.That’s really what it feels like. There is this club, where they keep the best booze and the comfiest chairs and all the keys to paradise, and all you need to get in unlock the mystic secrets of Home Making to get in. And the secret to unlocking the secrets is at the end of an invisible, seven part maze, outlined by the initiated in Costco, Lowes, and Bed Bath and Beyond.Am I alone in this? Is there a secret Rite of Initiation to get into The Right and Ancient Society of Adult, where there are instruction manuals that explain things like, you know, how to grocery shop and include vegetables? Because grownups always seem to have vegetables.And when I say vegetables, I mean real vegetables — carrots and lettuce and things. Not that green slop that your vegetables turn into at the bottom of the refrigerator two days after you come home from the grocery store. Proper vegetables. You know what I mean by that: You went to the store and bought basil and cilantro and spinach, feeling palpable dreams for the weekend and all the compliments about how you’re a real person and not a half-formed Caliban who fills out that corner of the food triangle with Jalapeno poppers. You considered the kale — of course you did — you hear it’s hip. But you decided on spinach. Keep it classic, you thought. Keep it classic.Then the day comes. Your peers are there, unsure what to do with their elbows or the hand not holding the beer. The look of concentration on their faces bespeaks that’s the main thing on their mind. You reach into the fridge drawer — cool and nonchalant — and say in an offhand way to your eager guests, “I’ll just make a salad, shall I?”Then your hand squelches on the ooze that replaced your vegetables. You immediately squash the thought, “I wish I had bought those four turtles I saw yesterday…” to save it for later. There is a time and a place for Splinter fantasies, and the struggle to maintain the illusion of competence during a “Grownup Ritual” is not one of them.Then you slam the fridge closed and get out the jalapeno poppers.That’s last weekend.Thing is, I feel like my parents always had access to salad. You could move for the stuff. There was miles of it. You’d think that they had it falling out their ears. I never even SAW them eat jalapeno poppers. Or oven-baked french fries. Tater tots were a special treat. They didn’t have any of these tepid variations on vegetables I find that I keep around because they seem to be the only thing hearty enough to withstand the force of my unfiltered glaring, because I can’t figure out what else it is that’s liquefying every natural substance in my fridge. Leftovers seem to be going bad constantly in there. I can’t keep a gallon of milk alive without intense life support. And I’ve started to charge the colony that was cheese rent, seeing as it hogs the wifi.I admit, those last items are probably my fault.I don’t know. It’s all confusing. Budget management. Grocery shopping. Adult social swim, when we go to the bar for half an hour, bitch about getting up too early and never having any fun, then go to bed at 9:30 to repeat the same old drudgery, and finding some meaning in that cycle. There’s got to be a Grownup Book of Laws or some classes or something that I missed somewhere.A lot of this makes no sense. If there isn’t something I missed, and this stumbling around like I’m being forced to wear a bag over my head while completing puzzles on top of a termite colony is “normal,” then life is a lot more peculiar than even I think, and I spend serious time thinking about gluons.Dispatches from the Adventure (Exclusive “news-lite” letter).Follow the Adventure (Patreon profile. Project announcements will be here).The Adventurer takes tips (PayPal tip jar).The challenge of writing aimlessly is just that: by feeling my way, I can’t guarantee or be guaranteed I’ll actually find a thread that unites everything, that ties everything up in a tidy package at the end.I titled this piece “Soup’s on,” and it is. A whole chicken is poaching on the stove in a bath of water, celery, carrots, onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, thyme, and parsley. It simmers gently on the stove as I type.Rain is falling in Northern California again. It drums a steady, insistent, increasingly frenetic beat on something metal outside the kitchen window. It’s warm in here, warm from the steamy soup, the roasting cauliflower, sweet potato, spring potato, white onion medley doused in olive oil and showered with salt and pepper at 400 degrees F. It’s warm from the bacon I just fried and the chicken liver I slipped into the side of the pan, into the bacon fat.That’s what I want to write about. Hallelujah, after months of dearth, of desert in the chicken innards market, I found giblets inside my chicken’s cavity tonight! This, after years and years (or at least it feels that long) of never-fail finding neck, heart, liver, and giblets in my chickens. Years of reliably retrieving these treasures: the heart, neck, and giblets for the soup; the liver a treat for myself, alone in the kitchen usually sauteed in butter, doused with sea salt and ground pepper, enjoyed alongside my glass of wine.I don’t mean to sequester myself in the kitchen this way. I don’t mean to secretly devour the liver of this chicken. I always invite my kids. Without fail.“Kids!” I call. “I cooked the liver. Do you want some liver? It’s delicious!”They always say with great emphasis, “No!”I am always secretly glad — more for me — and I enjoy a quiet, private moment of pleasure with my tiny, perfectly fried, shiny, buttery, singed liver, salty and sublime. Then a sip of red wine. Mmm.It’s a ritual, in other words.A few years ago (two? three?), I bought a chicken at my local market, brought it home, unwrapped it, got my stock pot out, reached into the cavity, and alas! Nothing! Nothing but space and air! No firm edges of heart, neck, and giblet. No soft liver that I must be gentle with and pull out whole, carefully.I thought it was a mistake, an accident, of course. I thought little of it. I was mildly disappointed, mildly annoyed, but I let it go. I forgot about it.A few days later, I brought a nicely wrapped natural, organic chicken home, unwrapped it, got my stock pot out, reached into the cavity, and… No innards! Again, no innards! This time, I was more than annoyed. Now, I knew something strange was up.I waited for this to happen a few more times before I called. I hoped against hope it was a fluke. A new packer, someone who didn’t understand.I just knew that it couldn’t be true, that innards no longer came with their chickens. It was sacrilege. It was impossible.When this had happened five or six or maybe seven times, I knew it was a thing. A sign of the new world. A new world order. I was pissed.Finally, I called my market. I tried to be polite, but I may have been testy. I knew how it would go. I knew what they would say. I knew what I would say. This was all pre-ordained. I followed the script.“Excuse me, my chicken that I bought this week didn’t have any innards… no liver, neck, giblets, or heart… right — no innards, no organ meats… mm hmm. mm hmm. Right. Well, I just want to say that I’m unhappy. I counted on those items. I used them, every week. They never went to waste. I miss them. I want them. Please tell your distributor.”Nothing happened. I missed my innards something awful, but I’m human which means I’m eminently adaptable. I adapted. Life went on.The other night, I stopped at Safeway. I don’t usually buy meat at Safeway. I don’t trust them. But, this “Open Nature” company has been appearing on the shelves lately. I haven’t checked them out, but I’m choosing to believe they are cleaner, more humane, smaller, more organic, less atrocious, less toxic, more healthy, less gross.I bought an Open Nature chicken. It was several dollars cheaper than the Mary’s organic chicken and the Safeway organic chicken that have also suddenly shown up in my local Safeway.Tonight, I pulled it out of the fridge and began my duties. This was after working hard all day, luckily from home today, but still, I barely stood up or stretched for far too many hours.I did however manage to slip away for a walk with Daisy at 6. We walked on the wet streets, beneath overcast skies. The air was scented with blooming jasmine even when I couldn’t see any. We passed a proud young evergreen, very symmetrical, with abundant new bright green needles adorning the ends of her arms like so many bracelets.I played a game I sometimes (okay, often) play with myself, imagining being able to buy a second house for my kids, for my friend who needs a house, to rent… to live in someday… whatever.I tell myself, “You have to pick the best house on the block, but you don’t even know what that is. Each house you pass, you have to say yes or no to. You can’t look ahead. You can’t change your mind.” Sometimes I fail and end up with a house that’s okay, but not the best on the block. Sometimes, I pick the right one. I look at the front, the sides, determine if there’s a front porch (big points for that), architectural details, mature trees, land…When I got home, the kids were ravenous. I started dinner. I reached in, out of habit, not because I expected anything, and lo and behold, my Open Nature chicken had innards! Yes! The works! Giblets, heart, neck, and liver. The whole shebang.After tucking my chicken into her pot with her associated aromatics and her giblets, neck, and heart (which deepens flavor), I noted the bacon slices I had frying in a large cast iron pan (simply because they’d been neglected and need to be cooked).Normally, I cook my chicken liver in a little cast iron pan just right for her, but I thought, heck, this bacon fat might be good to fry my liver in, and it’s already searing hot. Let’s just put the baby in there. And so I did.Then, I smattered her with sea salt and a few grindings of pepper and sauteed away. I was content. Tradition was restored.I called, “Guys, want a little liver?”The predictable answer came, “No! God, no!”Predictably, I smiled.I monitored my liver, turned her over, watched for perfectly singed edges. When she was perfect, I put her on a round white saucer, got a fork, found my stool, found my half-glass of red wine, and ate my liver in three bites. Like the old days. Like what used to be always.That’s what tradition is, isn’t it? I don’t really know about tradition. I don’t have many from my family of origin, and my daughter has complained about this. I still have very mixed feelings about my mother, painful feelings about my childhood. I haven’t exactly been hell-bent on reproducing key “traditions” of my childhood, let’s just put it that way. But sometimes I feel sure I’ve thrown the baby out with the bath water on that one. And I haven’t been too good about replacing them.Yet, we do have our traditions, even if they’re tiny, odd, and don’t seem like traditions. For example, for my children’s entire childhoods, I listened just about every Sunday afternoon to Chuy Varela’s Latin Jazz Program on KCSM, “the Bay Area’s Jazz Station.”I listened to this program on my grandfather’s radio, which was perched atop the refrigerator. Whether my kids knew it or not, whether they consciously heard it or not, I knew I was giving them something important, and I was proud of it: exposure to great music, to complex music, to a tradition of music, to Latin America, where their father was born, to an entire other culture, to something we don’t have in our North American culture or at least don’t see too often: this Caribbean, Latin hotness, for lack of a better word, to Latin rhythms, to the heart and soul of cultures known for their devotion to love, passion, family.I was glad for that, proud of that; I felt it was important.Then, my grandfather’s radio mysteriously disappeared.We haven’t heard Chuy’s show on Sundays since.This weekend, I will buy a new radio for the top of the fridge and re-instate Chuy to his rightful place, educating my children in the rhythms of Latin America and providing us all with a sense of ritual, tradition, holding.Because that’s what it’s about, isn’t it? Safety, belonging, dependability, security. The notion that while we know that many things change and will continue to change no matter how hard we try to hold on, others stay the same, at least as long as it takes to live a life. At least as long as it takes to raise a child."

    "contents": "I decided to lose weight after my ex-wife cheated on me stating that she found me unattractive, that she never loved me and that she was leaving and taking the dog with her. This personal narrative drove me to lose over 100lbs in 6 months and maintain that weight loss for over a year now. Emotional pain is an effective catalyst for change.I started eating 1,200 calories/day.Weight loss is pretty simple when you get down to it: Calories In - Calories Out = Weight Change. “Calories out” are a combination of TDEE (at-rest daily caloric expenditure), exercise and metabolism, while “calories in” are solely impacted by what you eat. The most accurate math I’ve seen shows that a 3,555 caloric deficit leads to the loss of 1lb of body fat.As an engineer-at-heart the decision seemed straight-forward: cut caloric intake beyond any healthy limit so I could lose the weight I wanted. As a 5&#39;6&quot; 275lbs male, I would need to consume 3,000+ calories daily to maintain my current weight. According to my calculations, If I reduced my daily caloric intake to 1,200 calories/day I would experience a 3lbs a week weight lose.

It’s been even more effective since I started adding Murphy’s Oil Soap to my “Welcome all comers” spray-down, leaving all my guests fragrant and freshly laundered for their social evening out.Just one of my little workarounds that make the labyrinth of adult life a little easier.Because that’s the real problem, isn’t it? Being a “grownup” — whatever those are — becomes this unmitigated requirement. “Grownups” are a band of incompetents, screwing up the world order at every level, and bumbling around alternately expanding out of their clothes and surprising themselves out of naps with their snores, and dictating short-sighted changes in world order to support their goals for comfier shoes and food that plays less havoc with their stomach juices.And yet their fumbling fellowship comes for all of us someday, gifting us with weight gain and hair loss and “responsibility” without so much as a, “thanks for your contribution — here’s your membership card.”They’re a sluggish, cautious species, more inclined to cough than groan and more inclined to groan than laugh, whose semi-permeable membranous definitions continuously encroach on all of the rest of us. One day we’re curing last night’s hangover and the worst headache of our life by planning how we’ll spend tonight punching ourselves in the face, and on the next day we’re getting a similar headache from choosing between two existentially identical laminated end tables and discovering that every headache we had ever experienced before barely deserved to be called pain.That’s the cruelty of the world, you see.There is a saying, I don’t know where it’s from really, that has come to be popular recently. Maybe you’ve seen it. It says: Age is mandatory — maturity is optional. Which is true, and in some cases manifestly conceived like an inalienable right.The problem with it is, maturity might be only an optional feature of life, but the weird science of “grown up responsibilities” — whatever that means — encroaches upon you whether you continue with the strict policy that your brain is made of cheese or not.I don’t have to be mature. Of course I don’t. I can whine and pout and maintain a whimsical understanding of reality for as long as I like. I probably will.The problem I have is, “I never got the memo…so…nah, I don’t feel like it,” does not appear to be a permissible argument in casual tax dodging. Young adults struggle to even find which ends are in question, and can’t even bring those ends within a hundred leagues of each other, let alone make them meet. I think the reason that “kids these days,” whoever they are, have a reputation for being sex crazed because when they hear “grownups” talk about making ends meet that what they really mean is the ends involved in visiting the recumbent discotheque.I don’t know what you call it. That’s what I call it.I have rarely, if ever, seen documentary evidence of the IRS responding to the young, confused, hungover and sore young people, with a genial clap on the shoulder and an assurance that at the next “grownup club” meeting that all would be made clear.That’s really what it feels like. There is this club, where they keep the best booze and the comfiest chairs and all the keys to paradise, and all you need to get in unlock the mystic secrets of Home Making to get in. And the secret to unlocking the secrets is at the end of an invisible, seven part maze, outlined by the initiated in Costco, Lowes, and Bed Bath and Beyond.Am I alone in this? Is there a secret Rite of Initiation to get into The Right and Ancient Society of Adult, where there are instruction manuals that explain things like, you know, how to grocery shop and include vegetables? Because grownups always seem to have vegetables.And when I say vegetables, I mean real vegetables — carrots and lettuce and things. Not that green slop that your vegetables turn into at the bottom of the refrigerator two days after you come home from the grocery store. Proper vegetables. You know what I mean by that: You went to the store and bought basil and cilantro and spinach, feeling palpable dreams for the weekend and all the compliments about how you’re a real person and not a half-formed Caliban who fills out that corner of the food triangle with Jalapeno poppers. You considered the kale — of course you did — you hear it’s hip. But you decided on spinach. Keep it classic, you thought. Keep it classic.Then the day comes. Your peers are there, unsure what to do with their elbows or the hand not holding the beer. The look of concentration on their faces bespeaks that’s the main thing on their mind. You reach into the fridge drawer — cool and nonchalant — and say in an offhand way to your eager guests, “I’ll just make a salad, shall I?”Then your hand squelches on the ooze that replaced your vegetables. You immediately squash the thought, “I wish I had bought those four turtles I saw yesterday…” to save it for later. There is a time and a place for Splinter fantasies, and the struggle to maintain the illusion of competence during a “Grownup Ritual” is not one of them.Then you slam the fridge closed and get out the jalapeno poppers.That’s last weekend.Thing is, I feel like my parents always had access to salad. You could move for the stuff. There was miles of it. You’d think that they had it falling out their ears. I never even SAW them eat jalapeno poppers. Or oven-baked french fries. Tater tots were a special treat. They didn’t have any of these tepid variations on vegetables I find that I keep around because they seem to be the only thing hearty enough to withstand the force of my unfiltered glaring, because I can’t figure out what else it is that’s liquefying every natural substance in my fridge. Leftovers seem to be going bad constantly in there. I can’t keep a gallon of milk alive without intense life support. And I’ve started to charge the colony that was cheese rent, seeing as it hogs the wifi.I admit, those last items are probably my fault.I don’t know. It’s all confusing. Budget management. Grocery shopping. Adult social swim, when we go to the bar for half an hour, bitch about getting up too early and never having any fun, then go to bed at 9:30 to repeat the same old drudgery, and finding some meaning in that cycle. There’s got to be a Grownup Book of Laws or some classes or something that I missed somewhere.A lot of this makes no sense. If there isn’t something I missed, and this stumbling around like I’m being forced to wear a bag over my head while completing puzzles on top of a termite colony is “normal,” then life is a lot more peculiar than even I think, and I spend serious time thinking about gluons.Dispatches from the Adventure (Exclusive “news-lite” letter).Follow the Adventure (Patreon profile. Project announcements will be here).The Adventurer takes tips (PayPal tip jar).The challenge of writing aimlessly is just that: by feeling my way, I can’t guarantee or be guaranteed I’ll actually find a thread that unites everything, that ties everything up in a tidy package at the end.I titled this piece “Soup’s on,” and it is. A whole chicken is poaching on the stove in a bath of water, celery, carrots, onion, bay leaf, peppercorns, thyme, and parsley. It simmers gently on the stove as I type.Rain is falling in Northern California again. It drums a steady, insistent, increasingly frenetic beat on something metal outside the kitchen window. It’s warm in here, warm from the steamy soup, the roasting cauliflower, sweet potato, spring potato, white onion medley doused in olive oil and showered with salt and pepper at 400 degrees F. It’s warm from the bacon I just fried and the chicken liver I slipped into the side of the pan, into the bacon fat.That’s what I want to write about. Hallelujah, after months of dearth, of desert in the chicken innards market, I found giblets inside my chicken’s cavity tonight! This, after years and years (or at least it feels that long) of never-fail finding neck, heart, liver, and giblets in my chickens. Years of reliably retrieving these treasures: the heart, neck, and giblets for the soup; the liver a treat for myself, alone in the kitchen usually sauteed in butter, doused with sea salt and ground pepper, enjoyed alongside my glass of wine.I don’t mean to sequester myself in the kitchen this way. I don’t mean to secretly devour the liver of this chicken. I always invite my kids. Without fail.“Kids!” I call. “I cooked the liver. Do you want some liver? It’s delicious!”They always say with great emphasis, “No!”I am always secretly glad — more for me — and I enjoy a quiet, private moment of pleasure with my tiny, perfectly fried, shiny, buttery, singed liver, salty and sublime. Then a sip of red wine. Mmm.It’s a ritual, in other words.A few years ago (two? three?), I bought a chicken at my local market, brought it home, unwrapped it, got my stock pot out, reached into the cavity, and alas! Nothing! Nothing but space and air! No firm edges of heart, neck, and giblet. No soft liver that I must be gentle with and pull out whole, carefully.I thought it was a mistake, an accident, of course. I thought little of it. I was mildly disappointed, mildly annoyed, but I let it go. I forgot about it.A few days later, I brought a nicely wrapped natural, organic chicken home, unwrapped it, got my stock pot out, reached into the cavity, and… No innards! Again, no innards! This time, I was more than annoyed. Now, I knew something strange was up.I waited for this to happen a few more times before I called. I hoped against hope it was a fluke. A new packer, someone who didn’t understand.I just knew that it couldn’t be true, that innards no longer came with their chickens. It was sacrilege. It was impossible.When this had happened five or six or maybe seven times, I knew it was a thing. A sign of the new world. A new world order. I was pissed.Finally, I called my market. I tried to be polite, but I may have been testy. I knew how it would go. I knew what they would say. I knew what I would say. This was all pre-ordained. I followed the script.“Excuse me, my chicken that I bought this week didn’t have any innards… no liver, neck, giblets, or heart… right — no innards, no organ meats… mm hmm. mm hmm. Right. Well, I just want to say that I’m unhappy. I counted on those items. I used them, every week. They never went to waste. I miss them. I want them. Please tell your distributor.”Nothing happened. I missed my innards something awful, but I’m human which means I’m eminently adaptable. I adapted. Life went on.The other night, I stopped at Safeway. I don’t usually buy meat at Safeway. I don’t trust them. But, this “Open Nature” company has been appearing on the shelves lately. I haven’t checked them out, but I’m choosing to believe they are cleaner, more humane, smaller, more organic, less atrocious, less toxic, more healthy, less gross.I bought an Open Nature chicken. It was several dollars cheaper than the Mary’s organic chicken and the Safeway organic chicken that have also suddenly shown up in my local Safeway.Tonight, I pulled it out of the fridge and began my duties. This was after working hard all day, luckily from home today, but still, I barely stood up or stretched for far too many hours.I did however manage to slip away for a walk with Daisy at 6. We walked on the wet streets, beneath overcast skies. The air was scented with blooming jasmine even when I couldn’t see any. We passed a proud young evergreen, very symmetrical, with abundant new bright green needles adorning the ends of her arms like so many bracelets.I played a game I sometimes (okay, often) play with myself, imagining being able to buy a second house for my kids, for my friend who needs a house, to rent… to live in someday… whatever.I tell myself, “You have to pick the best house on the block, but you don’t even know what that is. Each house you pass, you have to say yes or no to. You can’t look ahead. You can’t change your mind.” Sometimes I fail and end up with a house that’s okay, but not the best on the block. Sometimes, I pick the right one. I look at the front, the sides, determine if there’s a front porch (big points for that), architectural details, mature trees, land…When I got home, the kids were ravenous. I started dinner. I reached in, out of habit, not because I expected anything, and lo and behold, my Open Nature chicken had innards! Yes! The works! Giblets, heart, neck, and liver. The whole shebang.After tucking my chicken into her pot with her associated aromatics and her giblets, neck, and heart (which deepens flavor), I noted the bacon slices I had frying in a large cast iron pan (simply because they’d been neglected and need to be cooked).Normally, I cook my chicken liver in a little cast iron pan just right for her, but I thought, heck, this bacon fat might be good to fry my liver in, and it’s already searing hot. Let’s just put the baby in there. And so I did.Then, I smattered her with sea salt and a few grindings of pepper and sauteed away. I was content. Tradition was restored.I called, “Guys, want a little liver?”The predictable answer came, “No! God, no!”Predictably, I smiled.I monitored my liver, turned her over, watched for perfectly singed edges. When she was perfect, I put her on a round white saucer, got a fork, found my stool, found my half-glass of red wine, and ate my liver in three bites. Like the old days. Like what used to be always.That’s what tradition is, isn’t it? I don’t really know about tradition. I don’t have many from my family of origin, and my daughter has complained about this. I still have very mixed feelings about my mother, painful feelings about my childhood. I haven’t exactly been hell-bent on reproducing key “traditions” of my childhood, let’s just put it that way. But sometimes I feel sure I’ve thrown the baby out with the bath water on that one. And I haven’t been too good about replacing them.Yet, we do have our traditions, even if they’re tiny, odd, and don’t seem like traditions. For example, for my children’s entire childhoods, I listened just about every Sunday afternoon to Chuy Varela’s Latin Jazz Program on KCSM, “the Bay Area’s Jazz Station.”I listened to this program on my grandfather’s radio, which was perched atop the refrigerator. Whether my kids knew it or not, whether they consciously heard it or not, I knew I was giving them something important, and I was proud of it: exposure to great music, to complex music, to a tradition of music, to Latin America, where their father was born, to an entire other culture, to something we don’t have in our North American culture or at least don’t see too often: this Caribbean, Latin hotness, for lack of a better word, to Latin rhythms, to the heart and soul of cultures known for their devotion to love, passion, family.I was glad for that, proud of that; I felt it was important.Then, my grandfather’s radio mysteriously disappeared.We haven’t heard Chuy’s show on Sundays since.This weekend, I will buy a new radio for the top of the fridge and re-instate Chuy to his rightful place, educating my children in the rhythms of Latin America and providing us all with a sense of ritual, tradition, holding.Because that’s what it’s about, isn’t it? Safety, belonging, dependability, security. The notion that while we know that many things change and will continue to change no matter how hard we try to hold on, others stay the same, at least as long as it takes to live a life. At least as long as it takes to raise a child.This is one of the many recipes that Aaron and I want to share with you.
