    "contents": "10 years ago, I distinctly remember telling my parents that I wanted to be a professional gamer. Unlike most kids in my town, I wasn’t focused on becoming better at traditional sports. Instead, I was obsessed with climbing the ranks in video games. Typical of any parent at the time, mine laughed at the idea and told me to focus on going to college. I can’t hold it against them though, professional gaming was not a feasible or stable job, but…it was my childhood dream.My dream was formed out of a deep love for video games, and my envy of those few players who got paid to play video games all day.If we fast forward to today, millions of kids are now chasing the aforementioned dream job of mine, which is now in a ‘bucket’ that includes: professional gamer, social media star, YouTuber, or streamer.More specifically, they are aspiring to follow in the footsteps of the likes of: Casey Neistat, summit1G, PewDiePie, Cameron Dallas, Zach King, Huda Kattan, and Faker.These success stories prove that what was once crazy and irresponsible to pursue — now makes for both fame and fortune.In 2014, after surveying 1,500 respondents, Variety uncovered that the five most influential figures among Americans ages 13–18 were all YouTubers. These YouTubers ranked ahead of even the biggest traditional celebrities like Seth Rogan and Jennifer Lawrence.A major component of this influence shift is tied to how relatable these emerging stars are. This new generation of celebrities is coming about right before our eyes, and we are watching new stars being born from first view to millionth view every day.We are able to watch their first cringe-worthy videos on YouTube or posts on Instagram, and instead of making fun of them for it — we laugh alongside of them. We see a little bit of ourselves in their journey. By following someone throughout their road to success, it naturally feels more obtainable.A perfect example of this is Michelle Phan, who is very well-known for her make-up and beauty tutorials. Ten years ago, Michelle recorded her first make-up tutorial. The audio and video quality are terrible, but you can tell she was a natural at creating content.Today, Michelle Phan has amassed almost 8.8M subscribers and over 675M total views on her videos. She has earned several millions of dollars by doing what she loves.Another great example is the extremely famous videographer, Casey Neistat. Casey has vlogged over 200 days of his life. Over the course of several-hundred videos Casey quickly became one of the biggest celebrities on YouTube. In my opinion, Casey’s success can be explained by his authenticity and approachability. Casey is fundamentally genuine, and relatable. Despite never meeting Casey in real-life, I feel like I know him and his story intimately.With every new influencer, YouTube becomes more and more robust. Recently, YouTube announced that on average a billion hours of YouTube content is watched every single day. Influence over the masses is not only confined to YouTube. Professional gamers, social media stars, and streamers have similar appeal and they have platforms that have proven to be extremely lucrative.Getting rich is typically the motive behind a child’s dream job. However, I’d argue that the main driver behind these new dream jobs is actually passion. Even though the motives might be different, it turns out that you can still make a lot of money doing what you love.It’s important to break down the economics of these 4 new dream jobs:Last year, AdWeek covered the insane amount of money that influencers can make by posting sponsored content on Instagram.One of the most influential and famous Instagram accounts is FuckJerry, with over 11M followers. In December of 2016, it was expected that FuckJerry was charging around $30,000 per sponsored post. You read that right…$30,000 for a single post on Instagram.Another noteworthy example is style blogger Danielle Bernstein, who runs the Instagram account WeWoreWhat. According to an interview she did with Harper’s Bazaar, when she had 996K followers she was charging $5–15K per sponsored post. Today, she has over 1.6M followers on Instagram.Unlike social media stars, YouTubers do not solely rely on sponsored posts. Instead, they rely on ad revenue from YouTube directly. Depending on your following, your cost per thousand impressions (CPM) can change drastically.Recently, a popular YouTuber, RiceGum made a video showing how much he makes per month off of YouTube ad revenue.In February of 2017, RiceGum made around $68,000. To quote him, “This was actually my lowest paid month on YouTube, as I only got 20 million views. Keep in mind, over the summer I was averaging around 60–80 million views per month. I only posted four videos in February.”This means that RiceGum was earning around $3.40 per 1000 views (CPM). It’s worth noting that RiceGum is only 20 years old. In addition to having over 5 million subscribers on YouTube, RiceGum has a massive following on both Instagram (2.7M) and Twitter (1.3M).Using this conservative model of $3.40 per 1000 views, we can estimate that 17-year-old YouTube star Tanner Fox (4.2M subscribers) earned over $150,000 in February alone from his 47M views.Another success story is FaZe Clan: a group of teenagers that garnered initial attention from their Call of Duty trick-shot videos. Shortly after their videos started going viral, they decided to all move into a house together and record their daily lives. Recently, the six main YouTubers from FaZe Clan moved into a mansion worth over $10M in Beverly Hills, CA.Over the past year, we have seen very well-established traditional sport teams (and owners) start to invest in esports organizations. For example, the Boston Bruins, Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, etc. have all invested in esports teams.The revenue streams for both teams and players vary greatly depending on the game. However, the most common revenue streams for professional gamers are: salary from teams, tournament earnings, sponsorships, YouTube, and streaming.According to an anonymous survey conducted by ESPN of 33 League of Legends pro players, the average base salary of a North American League of Legends pro player was $105,385. League of Legends is by far the most popular game played competitively.For other games, such as Dota 2, the prize pools are well into the millions. In 2015, Sumail “Suma1L” Hassan Syed, a 16-year-old from Pakistan earned $1.2M when his team won Dota 2’s biggest tournament: The International. For context, in 2015, the total prize pool for The International was over $18M.As mentioned above, it is not uncommon for these professional gamers to stream on Twitch and make videos on YouTube when they are not playing competitively. As a result, there have been several professional gamers that decided to leave the competitive scene to become full-time streamers or YouTubers. The two most notable professional gamers that have turned towards pursuing careers on YouTube and Twitch full-time are Nadeshot and imaqtpie.Most streamers earn a bulk of their earnings from donations, subscribers, ads, and sponsorships. Donations are an extremely unique component of streaming, and if you’ve ever watched a Twitch stream, you’ve likely seen someone donate to a streamer.You are probably asking yourselves why viewers would donate to these “celebrities.” The biggest reason for donations is to get noticed by the streamer. In most cases, streamers will read off any donations they receive over a certain threshold. Imagine being able to pay LeBron James $5 to read off your 140-character message.As mentioned above, subscriptions are also a large component of earnings for streamers on Twitch. Viewers have the option to support streamers by subscribing to their stream for $5/month.Each streamer determines their own perks for subscribers. For example, most streamers allow subscribers to have custom emotes in chat. Additionally, most streamers give subscribers shoutouts at the time of subscribing.Whether you dream of becoming a professional gamer, social media star, YouTuber, or streamer, you are chasing these paths because it’s your passion. And I think everyone can agree that making your passion your job is the dream.In short, these influencers are just like you and I. They showcase the intimate details of their lives, and interact with their fans unlike any other celebrities have before them. They stumbled into these lifestyles by pursuing what they love. In return, they were greeted with both fame and wealth.We are entering a new era where, given the right circumstances, anyone can become an influencer. As a result, these new stars are starting to become far more marketable than traditional athletes or Hollywood celebrities.If (and when) your kid wants to chase his/her passion, whether it is playing video games or making beauty tutorials, I encourage you to support them."

Many of the rest consisted solely of vomiting green emoticons. Why?The furor began with a post that same day by Antônio de Sá, chief editor at Redbox, one of Brazil’s biggest tabletop RPG publishers.Fábio, he explained, had brought together four Brazilian companies: his own logistics company Rigo, plus three game publishers — RedBox, Meeple BR, and Fire On Board. The mistake, in de Sá’s view, was the decision to include Fire On Board.The companies formed a joint venture called FMR “for the sole purpose of publishing D&amp;D.” After months of meetings, plans, emails back and forth, the group felt they were on the verge of success thanks to their ‘in’ with Hasbro, when an unexpected hiccup occurred. Hasbro announced that UK game publisher Gale Force 9 was to be the sole foreign-language licensee, handling localization around the globe.Undeterred, the FMR team approached Gale Force 9. Even without the pre-existing relationship they’d enjoyed with Hasbro, they had a solid business case for getting the Portuguese licence: Rigo’s distribution expertise, RedBox’s history of success with RPG translations, and the game publishing and production know-how that Meeple BR and Fire On Board brought to the table.João Barcelos, owner of Fire on Board, represented FMR in these new negotiations, which took place in 2016. On the 20th of October, the board of FMR met Gale Force 9 representatives in person at the Spiel Essen convention in Germany. FMR was assured that all would be agreed soon — there was just the final contract to come, which was being drafted by Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro subsidiary that publishes D&amp;D in English.The FMR member companies formally set up their joint venture corporation and began dividing responsibilities among them at a meeting in Niterói on the 5th of November, 2016.As the only part of the group with experience producing tabletop RPGs, the Redbox team took on the editorial duties — translating the text, layout and graphic design. They hired professional contractors accordingly, with FMR members sharing the costs, says de Sá.Fire On Board disputes this account. “We had a face-to-face meeting but there was nothing concrete. We talked and shared ideas,” reads the statement on Facebook from CEO João Barcelos. “Redbox decided to go ahead with the translation. Afterwards, we were invoiced for this translation and paid it through a money transfer … Incidentally, we feel sorry for the translators who worked hard to deliver a good job that, although we never saw it, we are sure must have turned out pretty well, considering the people involved.”Why pay an invoice for work on a project you didn’t agree to be part of? This remains unexplained.“The contract from Wizards never came,” says de Sá. “The meetings João Barcelos attended were never reported clearly. Just short sentences without much direction, like ‘They’re tired after a convention. We’ll talk more next week.’ Things like that. The yellow warning light was beginning to turn orange.”The contract deadline was pushed back to January 2017, then to February. By then, other members of the FMR board had learnt that Fire On Board was advertising itself to retailer sales clients as “the Brazilian D&amp;D publisher.”On the day the contract was supposed to be signed, 15th of February 2017, Fire On Board sent the following email to the FMR board:Perplexed, FMR board members contacted Gale Force 9 and received what de Sá calls ‘a bombshell’: “Fire on Board already signed the Brazilian Portuguese D&amp;D contract. Sorry, but we don’t know about your story. Have a nice day.”“That was how we discovered we’d been screwed over,” says de Sá. “Really screwed.”On the 21st of March, Wizards of the Coast announced their global deal with Gale Force Nine. Their Brazilian distributor? Fire on Board, represented by João Barcelos.“We warned such companies at the time that we did not want to enter into any kind of agreement with them,” reads the Fire On Board CEO’s statement.Meeple BR stepped forward to dismiss Barcelos’s denial, saying “Yes, the claims in Redbox’s post are true, every line of them.”A statement by Fábio Ribeiro backed up de Sá’s story, adding that “after Fire on Board withdrew, Gale Force Nine told us they were dealing with a ‘new’ partner. You know what happened next, my friends. … It just makes me sad that the arrival of a product that so many people love has been tainted.”If Barcelos’ claims are true, it is difficult to explain the string of text messages, now posted online by Fabiano Neme — the lawyer responsible for the FMR project’s legal aspects — in which Barcelos discusses the project’s progress with the FMR members. “We have to start our internal organization,” says Barcelos in one message. “I’ll create a shared spreadsheet with print dates and deadlines.”Screenshots of emails and files released by Redbox on the 23rd of March appear even more incontrovertible. In an email dated 10th of March 2017, Barcelos writes to the three other FMR principals, “Here’s the spreadsheet with our decisions.” The attached Excel file describes the four prospective licensees as a joint venture.On the same day, Barcelos sends an email expressing approval of the new FMR logo designed by Dan Ramos, incorporating design elements of the Fire On Board, Meeple BR and Redbox logos.More damning yet is an English-language document in which the four FMR members make a joint presentation of their credentials for the D&amp;D licence. “We present to Hasbro–Wizards of the Coast the Companies that will be involved in the licensing partnership,” it reads.Gale Force 9 and Wizards of the Coast did not respond when contacted for comment. Questions remain over how much either knew, and when, about Fire On Board’s actions. At the meeting in Essen, the companies on the Brazilian side were all introduced as FMR members. Those present exchanged business cards showing their positions and the logos of their individual companies. “But we do not know how João Barcelos ‘justified’ this to Gale Force 9,” says de Sá.According to de Sá, the ousted FMR members decided against “blocking” the arrival of D&amp;D and thus preventing Brazilian roleplayers from getting their hands on the world’s most popular RPG in their own language. Nevertheless the threat of legal action remains, and in the meantime many gamers are calling online for a boycott of the Fire On Board product, or for Hasbro or Gale Force 9 to take action.Many Brazilian gamers know enough English to use the original books from Wizards of the coast. The English-language materials for D&amp;D 5th edition have also been available for some time, providing plenty of time for fan-translations to emerge. These factors make a boycott a much less painful proposition for a Portuguese-speaking dungeon-delver than it might otherwise be.Detractors, some of whom — quite apart from any ethical issues — find fault with Fire On Board’s previous work translating foreign board games, are also highlighting alternatives to D&amp;D, such as the Portuguese editions of Pathfinder and The One Ring, or Redbox’s own Old Dragon.What do Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro make of all this? At the time of writing, no statement has been forthcoming.ADDENDAFabiano Neme provides an account in English: https://nemenomicon.wordpress.com/dndgatebr/Translations into English of the our initial statements, by Pedro Coelho (Facebook comment links): 1) Initial statement by Redbox (Antônio de Sá) 2) Statement by Fire On Board (João Barcelos)3) Statement from Meeple BR4) Statement by Fábio Ribeiro"

Donations are an extremely unique component of streaming, and if you’ve ever watched a Twitch stream, you’ve likely seen someone donate to a streamer.You are probably asking yourselves why viewers would donate to these “celebrities.” The biggest reason for donations is to get noticed by the streamer. In most cases, streamers will read off any donations they receive over a certain threshold. Imagine being able to pay LeBron James $5 to read off your 140-character message.As mentioned above, subscriptions are also a large component of earnings for streamers on Twitch. Viewers have the option to support streamers by subscribing to their stream for $5/month.Each streamer determines their own perks for subscribers. For example, most streamers allow subscribers to have custom emotes in chat. Additionally, most streamers give subscribers shoutouts at the time of subscribing.Whether you dream of becoming a professional gamer, social media star, YouTuber, or streamer, you are chasing these paths because it’s your passion. And I think everyone can agree that making your passion your job is the dream.In short, these influencers are just like you and I. They showcase the intimate details of their lives, and interact with their fans unlike any other celebrities have before them. They stumbled into these lifestyles by pursuing what they love. In return, they were greeted with both fame and wealth.We are entering a new era where, given the right circumstances, anyone can become an influencer. As a result, these new stars are starting to become far more marketable than traditional athletes or Hollywood celebrities.If (and when) your kid wants to chase his/her passion, whether it is playing video games or making beauty tutorials, I encourage you to support them.On the 21st of March, the publishers of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) announced that the game’s 5th edition — by some measures its most successful version ever — was to be translated into seven new languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese, “with more to follow.”By the end of the day, Brazilian gamers were vowing to boycott the Portuguese-language version. “TRASH” read one comment typical of the hundreds under the Brazilian distributor’s announcement on Facebook. Many of the rest consisted solely of vomiting green emoticons. Why?The furor began with a post that same day by Antônio de Sá, chief editor at Redbox, one of Brazil’s biggest tabletop RPG publishers.Fábio, he explained, had brought together four Brazilian companies: his own logistics company Rigo, plus three game publishers — RedBox, Meeple BR, and Fire On Board. The mistake, in de Sá’s view, was the decision to include Fire On Board.The companies formed a joint venture called FMR “for the sole purpose of publishing D&amp;D.” After months of meetings, plans, emails back and forth, the group felt they were on the verge of success thanks to their ‘in’ with Hasbro, when an unexpected hiccup occurred. Hasbro announced that UK game publisher Gale Force 9 was to be the sole foreign-language licensee, handling localization around the globe.Undeterred, the FMR team approached Gale Force 9. Even without the pre-existing relationship they’d enjoyed with Hasbro, they had a solid business case for getting the Portuguese licence: Rigo’s distribution expertise, RedBox’s history of success with RPG translations, and the game publishing and production know-how that Meeple BR and Fire On Board brought to the table.João Barcelos, owner of Fire on Board, represented FMR in these new negotiations, which took place in 2016. On the 20th of October, the board of FMR met Gale Force 9 representatives in person at the Spiel Essen convention in Germany. FMR was assured that all would be agreed soon — there was just the final contract to come, which was being drafted by Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro subsidiary that publishes D&amp;D in English.The FMR member companies formally set up their joint venture corporation and began dividing responsibilities among them at a meeting in Niterói on the 5th of November, 2016.As the only part of the group with experience producing tabletop RPGs, the Redbox team took on the editorial duties — translating the text, layout and graphic design. They hired professional contractors accordingly, with FMR members sharing the costs, says de Sá.Fire On Board disputes this account. “We had a face-to-face meeting but there was nothing concrete. We talked and shared ideas,” reads the statement on Facebook from CEO João Barcelos. “Redbox decided to go ahead with the translation. Afterwards, we were invoiced for this translation and paid it through a money transfer … Incidentally, we feel sorry for the translators who worked hard to deliver a good job that, although we never saw it, we are sure must have turned out pretty well, considering the people involved.”Why pay an invoice for work on a project you didn’t agree to be part of? This remains unexplained.“The contract from Wizards never came,” says de Sá. “The meetings João Barcelos attended were never reported clearly. Just short sentences without much direction, like ‘They’re tired after a convention. We’ll talk more next week.’ Things like that. The yellow warning light was beginning to turn orange.”The contract deadline was pushed back to January 2017, then to February. By then, other members of the FMR board had learnt that Fire On Board was advertising itself to retailer sales clients as “the Brazilian D&amp;D publisher.”On the day the contract was supposed to be signed, 15th of February 2017, Fire On Board sent the following email to the FMR board:Perplexed, FMR board members contacted Gale Force 9 and received what de Sá calls ‘a bombshell’: “Fire on Board already signed the Brazilian Portuguese D&amp;D contract. Sorry, but we don’t know about your story. Have a nice day.”“That was how we discovered we’d been screwed over,” says de Sá. “Really screwed.”On the 21st of March, Wizards of the Coast announced their global deal with Gale Force Nine. Their Brazilian distributor? Fire on Board, represented by João Barcelos.“We warned such companies at the time that we did not want to enter into any kind of agreement with them,” reads the Fire On Board CEO’s statement.Meeple BR stepped forward to dismiss Barcelos’s denial, saying “Yes, the claims in Redbox’s post are true, every line of them.”A statement by Fábio Ribeiro backed up de Sá’s story, adding that “after Fire on Board withdrew, Gale Force Nine told us they were dealing with a ‘new’ partner. You know what happened next, my friends. … It just makes me sad that the arrival of a product that so many people love has been tainted.”If Barcelos’ claims are true, it is difficult to explain the string of text messages, now posted online by Fabiano Neme — the lawyer responsible for the FMR project’s legal aspects — in which Barcelos discusses the project’s progress with the FMR members. “We have to start our internal organization,” says Barcelos in one message. “I’ll create a shared spreadsheet with print dates and deadlines.”Screenshots of emails and files released by Redbox on the 23rd of March appear even more incontrovertible. In an email dated 10th of March 2017, Barcelos writes to the three other FMR principals, “Here’s the spreadsheet with our decisions.” The attached Excel file describes the four prospective licensees as a joint venture.On the same day, Barcelos sends an email expressing approval of the new FMR logo designed by Dan Ramos, incorporating design elements of the Fire On Board, Meeple BR and Redbox logos.More damning yet is an English-language document in which the four FMR members make a joint presentation of their credentials for the D&amp;D licence. “We present to Hasbro–Wizards of the Coast the Companies that will be involved in the licensing partnership,” it reads.Gale Force 9 and Wizards of the Coast did not respond when contacted for comment. Questions remain over how much either knew, and when, about Fire On Board’s actions. At the meeting in Essen, the companies on the Brazilian side were all introduced as FMR members. Those present exchanged business cards showing their positions and the logos of their individual companies. “But we do not know how João Barcelos ‘justified’ this to Gale Force 9,” says de Sá.According to de Sá, the ousted FMR members decided against “blocking” the arrival of D&amp;D and thus preventing Brazilian roleplayers from getting their hands on the world’s most popular RPG in their own language. Nevertheless the threat of legal action remains, and in the meantime many gamers are calling online for a boycott of the Fire On Board product, or for Hasbro or Gale Force 9 to take action.Many Brazilian gamers know enough English to use the original books from Wizards of the coast. The English-language materials for D&amp;D 5th edition have also been available for some time, providing plenty of time for fan-translations to emerge. These factors make a boycott a much less painful proposition for a Portuguese-speaking dungeon-delver than it might otherwise be.Detractors, some of whom — quite apart from any ethical issues — find fault with Fire On Board’s previous work translating foreign board games, are also highlighting alternatives to D&amp;D, such as the Portuguese editions of Pathfinder and The One Ring, or Redbox’s own Old Dragon.What do Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro make of all this? At the time of writing, no statement has been forthcoming.ADDENDAFabiano Neme provides an account in English: https://nemenomicon.wordpress.com/dndgatebr/Translations into English of the our initial statements, by Pedro Coelho (Facebook comment links): 1) Initial statement by Redbox (Antônio de Sá) 2) Statement by Fire On Board (João Barcelos)3) Statement from Meeple BR4) Statement by Fábio RibeiroPLAYTEST 1We’re in your truck.

    "contents": "10 years ago, I distinctly remember telling my parents that I wanted to be a professional gamer. Unlike most kids in my town, I wasn’t focused on becoming better at traditional sports. Instead, I was obsessed with climbing the ranks in video games. Typical of any parent at the time, mine laughed at the idea and told me to focus on going to college. I can’t hold it against them though, professional gaming was not a feasible or stable job, but…it was my childhood dream.My dream was formed out of a deep love for video games, and my envy of those few players who got paid to play video games all day.If we fast forward to today, millions of kids are now chasing the aforementioned dream job of mine, which is now in a ‘bucket’ that includes: professional gamer, social media star, YouTuber, or streamer.More specifically, they are aspiring to follow in the footsteps of the likes of: Casey Neistat, summit1G, PewDiePie, Cameron Dallas, Zach King, Huda Kattan, and Faker.These success stories prove that what was once crazy and irresponsible to pursue — now makes for both fame and fortune.In 2014, after surveying 1,500 respondents, Variety uncovered that the five most influential figures among Americans ages 13–18 were all YouTubers. These YouTubers ranked ahead of even the biggest traditional celebrities like Seth Rogan and Jennifer Lawrence.A major component of this influence shift is tied to how relatable these emerging stars are. This new generation of celebrities is coming about right before our eyes, and we are watching new stars being born from first view to millionth view every day.We are able to watch their first cringe-worthy videos on YouTube or posts on Instagram, and instead of making fun of them for it — we laugh alongside of them. We see a little bit of ourselves in their journey. By following someone throughout their road to success, it naturally feels more obtainable.A perfect example of this is Michelle Phan, who is very well-known for her make-up and beauty tutorials. Ten years ago, Michelle recorded her first make-up tutorial. The audio and video quality are terrible, but you can tell she was a natural at creating content.Today, Michelle Phan has amassed almost 8.8M subscribers and over 675M total views on her videos. She has earned several millions of dollars by doing what she loves.Another great example is the extremely famous videographer, Casey Neistat. Casey has vlogged over 200 days of his life. Over the course of several-hundred videos Casey quickly became one of the biggest celebrities on YouTube. In my opinion, Casey’s success can be explained by his authenticity and approachability. Casey is fundamentally genuine, and relatable. Despite never meeting Casey in real-life, I feel like I know him and his story intimately.With every new influencer, YouTube becomes more and more robust. Recently, YouTube announced that on average a billion hours of YouTube content is watched every single day. Influence over the masses is not only confined to YouTube. Professional gamers, social media stars, and streamers have similar appeal and they have platforms that have proven to be extremely lucrative.Getting rich is typically the motive behind a child’s dream job. However, I’d argue that the main driver behind these new dream jobs is actually passion. Even though the motives might be different, it turns out that you can still make a lot of money doing what you love.It’s important to break down the economics of these 4 new dream jobs:Last year, AdWeek covered the insane amount of money that influencers can make by posting sponsored content on Instagram.One of the most influential and famous Instagram accounts is FuckJerry, with over 11M followers. In December of 2016, it was expected that FuckJerry was charging around $30,000 per sponsored post. You read that right…$30,000 for a single post on Instagram.Another noteworthy example is style blogger Danielle Bernstein, who runs the Instagram account WeWoreWhat. According to an interview she did with Harper’s Bazaar, when she had 996K followers she was charging $5–15K per sponsored post. Today, she has over 1.6M followers on Instagram.Unlike social media stars, YouTubers do not solely rely on sponsored posts. Instead, they rely on ad revenue from YouTube directly. Depending on your following, your cost per thousand impressions (CPM) can change drastically.Recently, a popular YouTuber, RiceGum made a video showing how much he makes per month off of YouTube ad revenue.In February of 2017, RiceGum made around $68,000. To quote him, “This was actually my lowest paid month on YouTube, as I only got 20 million views. Keep in mind, over the summer I was averaging around 60–80 million views per month. I only posted four videos in February.”This means that RiceGum was earning around $3.40 per 1000 views (CPM). It’s worth noting that RiceGum is only 20 years old. In addition to having over 5 million subscribers on YouTube, RiceGum has a massive following on both Instagram (2.7M) and Twitter (1.3M).Using this conservative model of $3.40 per 1000 views, we can estimate that 17-year-old YouTube star Tanner Fox (4.2M subscribers) earned over $150,000 in February alone from his 47M views.Another success story is FaZe Clan: a group of teenagers that garnered initial attention from their Call of Duty trick-shot videos. Shortly after their videos started going viral, they decided to all move into a house together and record their daily lives. Recently, the six main YouTubers from FaZe Clan moved into a mansion worth over $10M in Beverly Hills, CA.Over the past year, we have seen very well-established traditional sport teams (and owners) start to invest in esports organizations. For example, the Boston Bruins, Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, etc. have all invested in esports teams.The revenue streams for both teams and players vary greatly depending on the game. However, the most common revenue streams for professional gamers are: salary from teams, tournament earnings, sponsorships, YouTube, and streaming.According to an anonymous survey conducted by ESPN of 33 League of Legends pro players, the average base salary of a North American League of Legends pro player was $105,385. League of Legends is by far the most popular game played competitively.For other games, such as Dota 2, the prize pools are well into the millions. In 2015, Sumail “Suma1L” Hassan Syed, a 16-year-old from Pakistan earned $1.2M when his team won Dota 2’s biggest tournament: The International. For context, in 2015, the total prize pool for The International was over $18M.As mentioned above, it is not uncommon for these professional gamers to stream on Twitch and make videos on YouTube when they are not playing competitively. As a result, there have been several professional gamers that decided to leave the competitive scene to become full-time streamers or YouTubers. The two most notable professional gamers that have turned towards pursuing careers on YouTube and Twitch full-time are Nadeshot and imaqtpie.Most streamers earn a bulk of their earnings from donations, subscribers, ads, and sponsorships. Donations are an extremely unique component of streaming, and if you’ve ever watched a Twitch stream, you’ve likely seen someone donate to a streamer.You are probably asking yourselves why viewers would donate to these “celebrities.” The biggest reason for donations is to get noticed by the streamer. In most cases, streamers will read off any donations they receive over a certain threshold. Imagine being able to pay LeBron James $5 to read off your 140-character message.As mentioned above, subscriptions are also a large component of earnings for streamers on Twitch. Viewers have the option to support streamers by subscribing to their stream for $5/month.Each streamer determines their own perks for subscribers. For example, most streamers allow subscribers to have custom emotes in chat.

As a result, these new stars are starting to become far more marketable than traditional athletes or Hollywood celebrities.If (and when) your kid wants to chase his/her passion, whether it is playing video games or making beauty tutorials, I encourage you to support them.On the 21st of March, the publishers of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) announced that the game’s 5th edition — by some measures its most successful version ever — was to be translated into seven new languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese, “with more to follow.”By the end of the day, Brazilian gamers were vowing to boycott the Portuguese-language version. “TRASH” read one comment typical of the hundreds under the Brazilian distributor’s announcement on Facebook.

That means as many as 190 stores could be on the chopping block.GameStop currently operates more than 6,600 stores globally, including 4,400 in the United States. It’s unclear how many domestic stores the Texas-based company plans to close.The retailer of new and used video games has been on shaky ground for a while. Its stock has plummeted more than 31% over the past year.On Thursday, the company said its overall sales fell 13.6% last quarter compared to a year prior.At the core of GameStop’s issues: It’s not selling enough video games.CEO Paul Raines said in a statement Thursday that “the video game category was weak, particularly in the back half of 2016.”That’s because the biggest names in gaming — Playstation maker Sony and Xbox maker Microsoft — haven’t updated their consoles in a while, Raines said. That creates a lag in business for retailers like GameStop.Bright spots for GameStop include its non-gaming related brands, like Spring Mobile, and its sales of pop culture collectibles, which are sold at GameStop stores.GameStop is just one name among a long list of brick-and-mortar retailers struggling to compete with e-commerce giants like Amazo.Over the past year, chains including JCPenney, Macy’s and Staples have announced store closures. And earlier this week, Sears — which also owns Kmart — said it has “substantial doubt” the company will survive. x"

Over the course of several-hundred videos Casey quickly became one of the biggest celebrities on YouTube. In my opinion, Casey’s success can be explained by his authenticity and approachability. Casey is fundamentally genuine, and relatable. Despite never meeting Casey in real-life, I feel like I know him and his story intimately.With every new influencer, YouTube becomes more and more robust. Recently, YouTube announced that on average a billion hours of YouTube content is watched every single day. Influence over the masses is not only confined to YouTube. Professional gamers, social media stars, and streamers have similar appeal and they have platforms that have proven to be extremely lucrative.Getting rich is typically the motive behind a child’s dream job. However, I’d argue that the main driver behind these new dream jobs is actually passion. Even though the motives might be different, it turns out that you can still make a lot of money doing what you love.It’s important to break down the economics of these 4 new dream jobs:Last year, AdWeek covered the insane amount of money that influencers can make by posting sponsored content on Instagram.One of the most influential and famous Instagram accounts is FuckJerry, with over 11M followers. In December of 2016, it was expected that FuckJerry was charging around $30,000 per sponsored post. You read that right…$30,000 for a single post on Instagram.Another noteworthy example is style blogger Danielle Bernstein, who runs the Instagram account WeWoreWhat. According to an interview she did with Harper’s Bazaar, when she had 996K followers she was charging $5–15K per sponsored post. Today, she has over 1.6M followers on Instagram.Unlike social media stars, YouTubers do not solely rely on sponsored posts. Instead, they rely on ad revenue from YouTube directly. Depending on your following, your cost per thousand impressions (CPM) can change drastically.Recently, a popular YouTuber, RiceGum made a video showing how much he makes per month off of YouTube ad revenue.In February of 2017, RiceGum made around $68,000. To quote him, “This was actually my lowest paid month on YouTube, as I only got 20 million views. Keep in mind, over the summer I was averaging around 60–80 million views per month. I only posted four videos in February.”This means that RiceGum was earning around $3.40 per 1000 views (CPM). It’s worth noting that RiceGum is only 20 years old. In addition to having over 5 million subscribers on YouTube, RiceGum has a massive following on both Instagram (2.7M) and Twitter (1.3M).Using this conservative model of $3.40 per 1000 views, we can estimate that 17-year-old YouTube star Tanner Fox (4.2M subscribers) earned over $150,000 in February alone from his 47M views.Another success story is FaZe Clan: a group of teenagers that garnered initial attention from their Call of Duty trick-shot videos. Shortly after their videos started going viral, they decided to all move into a house together and record their daily lives. Recently, the six main YouTubers from FaZe Clan moved into a mansion worth over $10M in Beverly Hills, CA.Over the past year, we have seen very well-established traditional sport teams (and owners) start to invest in esports organizations. For example, the Boston Bruins, Philadelphia 76ers, Miami Heat, etc. have all invested in esports teams.The revenue streams for both teams and players vary greatly depending on the game. However, the most common revenue streams for professional gamers are: salary from teams, tournament earnings, sponsorships, YouTube, and streaming.According to an anonymous survey conducted by ESPN of 33 League of Legends pro players, the average base salary of a North American League of Legends pro player was $105,385. League of Legends is by far the most popular game played competitively.For other games, such as Dota 2, the prize pools are well into the millions. In 2015, Sumail “Suma1L” Hassan Syed, a 16-year-old from Pakistan earned $1.2M when his team won Dota 2’s biggest tournament: The International. For context, in 2015, the total prize pool for The International was over $18M.As mentioned above, it is not uncommon for these professional gamers to stream on Twitch and make videos on YouTube when they are not playing competitively. As a result, there have been several professional gamers that decided to leave the competitive scene to become full-time streamers or YouTubers. The two most notable professional gamers that have turned towards pursuing careers on YouTube and Twitch full-time are Nadeshot and imaqtpie.Most streamers earn a bulk of their earnings from donations, subscribers, ads, and sponsorships. Donations are an extremely unique component of streaming, and if you’ve ever watched a Twitch stream, you’ve likely seen someone donate to a streamer.You are probably asking yourselves why viewers would donate to these “celebrities.” The biggest reason for donations is to get noticed by the streamer. In most cases, streamers will read off any donations they receive over a certain threshold. Imagine being able to pay LeBron James $5 to read off your 140-character message.As mentioned above, subscriptions are also a large component of earnings for streamers on Twitch. Viewers have the option to support streamers by subscribing to their stream for $5/month.Each streamer determines their own perks for subscribers. For example, most streamers allow subscribers to have custom emotes in chat. Additionally, most streamers give subscribers shoutouts at the time of subscribing.Whether you dream of becoming a professional gamer, social media star, YouTuber, or streamer, you are chasing these paths because it’s your passion. And I think everyone can agree that making your passion your job is the dream.In short, these influencers are just like you and I. They showcase the intimate details of their lives, and interact with their fans unlike any other celebrities have before them. They stumbled into these lifestyles by pursuing what they love. In return, they were greeted with both fame and wealth.We are entering a new era where, given the right circumstances, anyone can become an influencer. As a result, these new stars are starting to become far more marketable than traditional athletes or Hollywood celebrities.If (and when) your kid wants to chase his/her passion, whether it is playing video games or making beauty tutorials, I encourage you to support them.On the 21st of March, the publishers of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) announced that the game’s 5th edition — by some measures its most successful version ever — was to be translated into seven new languages: French, German, Italian, Japanese, Spanish, Polish, and Portuguese, “with more to follow.”By the end of the day, Brazilian gamers were vowing to boycott the Portuguese-language version. “TRASH” read one comment typical of the hundreds under the Brazilian distributor’s announcement on Facebook. Many of the rest consisted solely of vomiting green emoticons. Why?The furor began with a post that same day by Antônio de Sá, chief editor at Redbox, one of Brazil’s biggest tabletop RPG publishers.Fábio, he explained, had brought together four Brazilian companies: his own logistics company Rigo, plus three game publishers — RedBox, Meeple BR, and Fire On Board. The mistake, in de Sá’s view, was the decision to include Fire On Board.The companies formed a joint venture called FMR “for the sole purpose of publishing D&amp;D.” After months of meetings, plans, emails back and forth, the group felt they were on the verge of success thanks to their ‘in’ with Hasbro, when an unexpected hiccup occurred. Hasbro announced that UK game publisher Gale Force 9 was to be the sole foreign-language licensee, handling localization around the globe.Undeterred, the FMR team approached Gale Force 9. Even without the pre-existing relationship they’d enjoyed with Hasbro, they had a solid business case for getting the Portuguese licence: Rigo’s distribution expertise, RedBox’s history of success with RPG translations, and the game publishing and production know-how that Meeple BR and Fire On Board brought to the table.João Barcelos, owner of Fire on Board, represented FMR in these new negotiations, which took place in 2016. On the 20th of October, the board of FMR met Gale Force 9 representatives in person at the Spiel Essen convention in Germany. FMR was assured that all would be agreed soon — there was just the final contract to come, which was being drafted by Wizards of the Coast, the Hasbro subsidiary that publishes D&amp;D in English.The FMR member companies formally set up their joint venture corporation and began dividing responsibilities among them at a meeting in Niterói on the 5th of November, 2016.As the only part of the group with experience producing tabletop RPGs, the Redbox team took on the editorial duties — translating the text, layout and graphic design. They hired professional contractors accordingly, with FMR members sharing the costs, says de Sá.Fire On Board disputes this account. “We had a face-to-face meeting but there was nothing concrete. We talked and shared ideas,” reads the statement on Facebook from CEO João Barcelos. “Redbox decided to go ahead with the translation. Afterwards, we were invoiced for this translation and paid it through a money transfer … Incidentally, we feel sorry for the translators who worked hard to deliver a good job that, although we never saw it, we are sure must have turned out pretty well, considering the people involved.”Why pay an invoice for work on a project you didn’t agree to be part of? This remains unexplained.“The contract from Wizards never came,” says de Sá. “The meetings João Barcelos attended were never reported clearly. Just short sentences without much direction, like ‘They’re tired after a convention. We’ll talk more next week.’ Things like that. The yellow warning light was beginning to turn orange.”The contract deadline was pushed back to January 2017, then to February. By then, other members of the FMR board had learnt that Fire On Board was advertising itself to retailer sales clients as “the Brazilian D&amp;D publisher.”On the day the contract was supposed to be signed, 15th of February 2017, Fire On Board sent the following email to the FMR board:Perplexed, FMR board members contacted Gale Force 9 and received what de Sá calls ‘a bombshell’: “Fire on Board already signed the Brazilian Portuguese D&amp;D contract. Sorry, but we don’t know about your story. Have a nice day.”“That was how we discovered we’d been screwed over,” says de Sá. “Really screwed.”On the 21st of March, Wizards of the Coast announced their global deal with Gale Force Nine. Their Brazilian distributor? Fire on Board, represented by João Barcelos.“We warned such companies at the time that we did not want to enter into any kind of agreement with them,” reads the Fire On Board CEO’s statement.Meeple BR stepped forward to dismiss Barcelos’s denial, saying “Yes, the claims in Redbox’s post are true, every line of them.”A statement by Fábio Ribeiro backed up de Sá’s story, adding that “after Fire on Board withdrew, Gale Force Nine told us they were dealing with a ‘new’ partner. You know what happened next, my friends. … It just makes me sad that the arrival of a product that so many people love has been tainted.”If Barcelos’ claims are true, it is difficult to explain the string of text messages, now posted online by Fabiano Neme — the lawyer responsible for the FMR project’s legal aspects — in which Barcelos discusses the project’s progress with the FMR members. “We have to start our internal organization,” says Barcelos in one message. “I’ll create a shared spreadsheet with print dates and deadlines.”Screenshots of emails and files released by Redbox on the 23rd of March appear even more incontrovertible. In an email dated 10th of March 2017, Barcelos writes to the three other FMR principals, “Here’s the spreadsheet with our decisions.” The attached Excel file describes the four prospective licensees as a joint venture.On the same day, Barcelos sends an email expressing approval of the new FMR logo designed by Dan Ramos, incorporating design elements of the Fire On Board, Meeple BR and Redbox logos.More damning yet is an English-language document in which the four FMR members make a joint presentation of their credentials for the D&amp;D licence. “We present to Hasbro–Wizards of the Coast the Companies that will be involved in the licensing partnership,” it reads.Gale Force 9 and Wizards of the Coast did not respond when contacted for comment. Questions remain over how much either knew, and when, about Fire On Board’s actions. At the meeting in Essen, the companies on the Brazilian side were all introduced as FMR members. Those present exchanged business cards showing their positions and the logos of their individual companies. “But we do not know how João Barcelos ‘justified’ this to Gale Force 9,” says de Sá.According to de Sá, the ousted FMR members decided against “blocking” the arrival of D&amp;D and thus preventing Brazilian roleplayers from getting their hands on the world’s most popular RPG in their own language. Nevertheless the threat of legal action remains, and in the meantime many gamers are calling online for a boycott of the Fire On Board product, or for Hasbro or Gale Force 9 to take action.Many Brazilian gamers know enough English to use the original books from Wizards of the coast. The English-language materials for D&amp;D 5th edition have also been available for some time, providing plenty of time for fan-translations to emerge. These factors make a boycott a much less painful proposition for a Portuguese-speaking dungeon-delver than it might otherwise be.Detractors, some of whom — quite apart from any ethical issues — find fault with Fire On Board’s previous work translating foreign board games, are also highlighting alternatives to D&amp;D, such as the Portuguese editions of Pathfinder and The One Ring, or Redbox’s own Old Dragon.What do Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro make of all this? At the time of writing, no statement has been forthcoming.ADDENDAFabiano Neme provides an account in English: https://nemenomicon.wordpress.com/dndgatebr/Translations into English of the our initial statements, by Pedro Coelho (Facebook comment links): 1) Initial statement by Redbox (Antônio de Sá) 2) Statement by Fire On Board (João Barcelos)3) Statement from Meeple BR4) Statement by Fábio RibeiroPLAYTEST 1We’re in your truck.

That means as many as 190 stores could be on the chopping block.GameStop currently operates more than 6,600 stores globally, including 4,400 in the United States. It’s unclear how many domestic stores the Texas-based company plans to close.The retailer of new and used video games has been on shaky ground for a while. Its stock has plummeted more than 31% over the past year.On Thursday, the company said its overall sales fell 13.6% last quarter compared to a year prior.At the core of GameStop’s issues: It’s not selling enough video games.CEO Paul Raines said in a statement Thursday that “the video game category was weak, particularly in the back half of 2016.”That’s because the biggest names in gaming — Playstation maker Sony and Xbox maker Microsoft — haven’t updated their consoles in a while, Raines said. That creates a lag in business for retailers like GameStop.Bright spots for GameStop include its non-gaming related brands, like Spring Mobile, and its sales of pop culture collectibles, which are sold at GameStop stores.GameStop is just one name among a long list of brick-and-mortar retailers struggling to compete with e-commerce giants like Amazo.Over the past year, chains including JCPenney, Macy’s and Staples have announced store closures. And earlier this week, Sears — which also owns Kmart — said it has “substantial doubt” the company will survive. xIn September of 2014 Columbia College President Dr. Scott Dalrymple found himself in the national spotlight after offering free textbooks for a year to any student that could beat him in Madden NFL.He lost and ended up making good on his promise.
