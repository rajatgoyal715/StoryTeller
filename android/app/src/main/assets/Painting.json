He also works from photographic images (often of his own paintings), which he alters in Photoshop, prints, and then sometimes paints on again, and so forth.For instance, to make Polaroid Painting (2016), (which ultimately consists of UV ink printed on canvas) one might infer that Elrod went through a convoluted process of photography, digital alteration, spray painting, re-photographing and printing to make the final product.Deciphering his process is enough to make your head spin, but to do so is to miss the point: the sooner we stop slavishly attempting to differentiate the “screen space,” as he calls it, from analog media such as tape and acrylic, the sooner we can appreciate his paintings for what they really are.His squiggly, mouse-drawn gesture (dubbed “frictionless drawing” by the artist) serves to heighten our awareness that we are operating in screen space, but also, as a style of brushwork, it channels the angsty dynamism of Abstract Expressionism.Elrod’s action of swiftly swishing a mouse back and forth across a pad is a computer-age analog to Jackson Pollock slinging paint with a stick. This connection was more obvious in his previous work, such as Dream Machine: For Brion Gysin (2009), a large rectangular painting consisting of overlapping black-and-white computer squiggles rendered in acrylic, which visually echoes Pollock’s paintings, such as Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950), in which looping sworls of black and white paint crisscross one another in a similar fashion.Gysin’s dream machine was cited in the show’s press release as a source of inspiration for Elrod’s newer style of blur paintings, at the gallery’s sleek and cavernous Bushwick space. Gysin was an artist and poet and a friend of William Burroughs; his dream machine was a spinning magic lantern-like device designed to induce dreams and visions.Both the dream machine and the “cut-up” method developed by Gysin and Burroughs—in which they created quasi-random poems from eviscerated pages of text—were means of accessing the collective unconscious. Elrod’s blur paintings may well constitute a third method.Starting from hand-painted or hand-drawn compositions, Elrod uses Photoshop to heavily blur the forms then prints them on canvas. This may sound relatively simple, but the visual effect produced is anything but: the paintings appear to vibrate and quiver as the shapes refuse to come into focus, and the longer you stare at them, the more imaginary figures and creepy faces begin to emerge from the fuzzy depths. Such mesmerizing effects may owe something to the paintings’ staggering scale, measuring from 12 by 9 feet up to a whopping 12 by 20 1/2 feet.There are two slightly smaller blur paintings at the Chelsea space. The first, Auto-focus (2016), greeted viewers as they entered the gallery, and featured a thin, white, rectangular line imposed over a blur field, suggesting that we are viewing an image through the viewfinder of a phone or camera, as the title implies. The other, Primal Screen (2016), was also typical, save for two jagged-edged (though perfectly fabricated) clefts on the left side of the canvas. These two pieces served to bridge the separate halves of the show, as the hard edge line in Auto-focus and the shaped canvas in Primal Screen are both motifs that can be found in many of the Chelsea paintings. What’s more, their titles provide valuable insight into the concerns undergirding the exhibition as a whole.To invoke the mechanism of auto-focus becomes ironic when the image in question is intentionally blurred, and in a similar way, the word play in Primal Screen subverts our expectations by uploading an animalistic concept into the disembodied screen space. However, given the increasing extent to which human experience is mediated by screens, the idea that there exists a clear binary division between “the virtual world” and “the real world” is becoming increasingly quaint.The truth is that these two worlds bleed into one another and are in fact just aspects of a single reality — the one in which we live — and it is to this complex reality, with all of its contradictions, that This Brutal World refers.By Dave Willis, Founder of Willis Art AdvisoryInstagram: @willisartadvisoryFacebook: Willis Art Advisory"

Sleep, what is sleep, all that I have is pain to keep ~ bjf © ~ Edgar Allan Poe’s mother passed away from tuberculosis (consumption) when he was 2, his wife same disease @ 28 and he himself, again same disease, at age 40.I walked down Falkoner Alle today searching in vain for a chocolate festival with 100% cocoa that I later discovered had relocated to a new venue, Forum, since last year.As I strode along, warmed in the sub-zero temperatures by my ski pants and hiking boots, I happened to glance in the window of an art gallery from the street.I pressed my forehead against the cold glass and the paintings called me irresistibly closer. I pushed against the heavy door and beheld the glorious pre-exhibition canvasses leaning up against the walls, spread out in front of me, pulling me in.The gallery owner came out to meet me and as we spoke, I felt tears flowing down my cheeks. I can’t tell you that I was conscious of any pain. Neither was I aware of any other overwhelming emotion. Yet my cheeks were wet and the tears continued to flow. I asked about the opening and the dealer gave me the information and that I was welcome to attend the following Saturday and meet the artist.There was a painting of a woman in a bed; I could almost feel the warmth of the crumpled duvet and the feathers inside. The smell of musk and sweet sweat hung in the air as she smiled invitingly.The second painting that the dealer showed me, of a partly-shadowed homestead was undramatic, despite the light and dark contrasts but the warmth and humanity that permeated the motif was almost palpable.I don’t remember the other paintings. The dealer informed me that the bedroom painting would be a full-page spread in Politiken the next day; I could see why.Or rather, I couldn’t SEE why, I could only observe this lachrymous fluid gushing from my eyes without rhyme or reason; a strange and unknown (to me) artist having demonstrated the power he had over my emotions.If it had that effect on me, it probably had that effect on others too.See you at 14.00 on Saturday at Oxholm gallery on Pile Alle 25. I’m happy I got an invitation, that I don’t have to gatecrash this one, like I gatecrashed Rufus’s talk at Politiken Plus last week.Thank you for reading this far.If you liked this, you might also like:"

I am attempting to make my newest work more like sculpture and hope the work encourages the viewer to move from left to right or vice versa to see the changes that occur in the shape and color from the different perspectives.”24 x 24Style and TechniqueBasic, raw and stretching boundaries, Pat McNabb Martin leaves each composition to the viewer’s discretion. Never over intellectualizing a painting she concerns herself with the canvas surface always experimenting to create new and unique marks. Each painting is an emergent field of color often laced with exotic fluorescent and metallic paints. Her intuitive use of the canvas surface, texture and color saturates the viewer’s eye allowing for personal interpretation.Pat McNabb Martin is an accomplished art educator, filmmaker, graphic designer and manufacturer/designer of hand painted women’s clothing and accessories. For eighteen years she designed and built single family homes on spec in Southern CA., where she currently resides. In 2002 she returned to painting full time.“There are times I begin a painting with a preconceived notion of what I want to have happen and sometimes I approach a blank canvas letting the paint and process show me the way. Traditional artist brushes limit my freedom so my studio is full of utensils, knives, paints sticks and squeegees. Continuously adding, subtracting, painting over and painting out, allows the mystery of technique to keep me interested.My creative search remains investigative with the hope that in every painting the color and texture will rise to a new level of visual promise”.The art of art, the glory of expression and the sunshine of the light of letters, is the simplicity in design.Fields“Most of these paintings, like so many of those in other series, are about assorted types of earth and seascapes. The predominate methods used to make this work are similar to ones in the action series, but a more controlled and subtle relation to the marks on the canvas of many of these works can be seen. Using smaller amounts of paint applied layer after layer almost like air brushing help create an array of many different colors which define the composition.”STRATA SERIES“I wanted to take my somewhat textural painting to a new level.

He also works from photographic images (often of his own paintings), which he alters in Photoshop, prints, and then sometimes paints on again, and so forth.For instance, to make Polaroid Painting (2016), (which ultimately consists of UV ink printed on canvas) one might infer that Elrod went through a convoluted process of photography, digital alteration, spray painting, re-photographing and printing to make the final product.Deciphering his process is enough to make your head spin, but to do so is to miss the point: the sooner we stop slavishly attempting to differentiate the “screen space,” as he calls it, from analog media such as tape and acrylic, the sooner we can appreciate his paintings for what they really are.His squiggly, mouse-drawn gesture (dubbed “frictionless drawing” by the artist) serves to heighten our awareness that we are operating in screen space, but also, as a style of brushwork, it channels the angsty dynamism of Abstract Expressionism.Elrod’s action of swiftly swishing a mouse back and forth across a pad is a computer-age analog to Jackson Pollock slinging paint with a stick. This connection was more obvious in his previous work, such as Dream Machine: For Brion Gysin (2009), a large rectangular painting consisting of overlapping black-and-white computer squiggles rendered in acrylic, which visually echoes Pollock’s paintings, such as Autumn Rhythm (Number 30) (1950), in which looping sworls of black and white paint crisscross one another in a similar fashion.Gysin’s dream machine was cited in the show’s press release as a source of inspiration for Elrod’s newer style of blur paintings, at the gallery’s sleek and cavernous Bushwick space. Gysin was an artist and poet and a friend of William Burroughs; his dream machine was a spinning magic lantern-like device designed to induce dreams and visions.Both the dream machine and the “cut-up” method developed by Gysin and Burroughs—in which they created quasi-random poems from eviscerated pages of text—were means of accessing the collective unconscious. Elrod’s blur paintings may well constitute a third method.Starting from hand-painted or hand-drawn compositions, Elrod uses Photoshop to heavily blur the forms then prints them on canvas. This may sound relatively simple, but the visual effect produced is anything but: the paintings appear to vibrate and quiver as the shapes refuse to come into focus, and the longer you stare at them, the more imaginary figures and creepy faces begin to emerge from the fuzzy depths. Such mesmerizing effects may owe something to the paintings’ staggering scale, measuring from 12 by 9 feet up to a whopping 12 by 20 1/2 feet.There are two slightly smaller blur paintings at the Chelsea space. The first, Auto-focus (2016), greeted viewers as they entered the gallery, and featured a thin, white, rectangular line imposed over a blur field, suggesting that we are viewing an image through the viewfinder of a phone or camera, as the title implies. The other, Primal Screen (2016), was also typical, save for two jagged-edged (though perfectly fabricated) clefts on the left side of the canvas. These two pieces served to bridge the separate halves of the show, as the hard edge line in Auto-focus and the shaped canvas in Primal Screen are both motifs that can be found in many of the Chelsea paintings. What’s more, their titles provide valuable insight into the concerns undergirding the exhibition as a whole.To invoke the mechanism of auto-focus becomes ironic when the image in question is intentionally blurred, and in a similar way, the word play in Primal Screen subverts our expectations by uploading an animalistic concept into the disembodied screen space. However, given the increasing extent to which human experience is mediated by screens, the idea that there exists a clear binary division between “the virtual world” and “the real world” is becoming increasingly quaint.The truth is that these two worlds bleed into one another and are in fact just aspects of a single reality — the one in which we live — and it is to this complex reality, with all of its contradictions, that This Brutal World refers.By Dave Willis, Founder of Willis Art AdvisoryInstagram: @willisartadvisoryFacebook: Willis Art Advisory~ Pierced (Dora Maar — photographer) ~ You captured light in your camera, but could not hold it within your heart.

She adored the southwest though that was not where she was born. Still, that was where she had to go and so she made her home in New Mexico. She played host on her ranch called “Ghost” then at Abiquiu &amp; her red hills. She embraced peace, solitude and a beautiful view, a life simple and free.

Sleep, what is sleep, all that I have is pain to keep. Why I write not about sweet church bells or floral bluebells, ah, yes, well, I would were my world not so stark for sadly this life of mine dwells in the dark. I wander from street to street, for all that I have is pain to keep ‘til I’m finally set free, when my last breath is choked from me. Cough, this bloody cough brings me down, my days are hell,my nights as well. Sleep, what is sleep, all that I have is pain to keep ~ bjf © ~ Edgar Allan Poe’s mother passed away from tuberculosis (consumption) when he was 2, his wife same disease @ 28 and he himself, again same disease, at age 40.I walked down Falkoner Alle today searching in vain for a chocolate festival with 100% cocoa that I later discovered had relocated to a new venue, Forum, since last year.As I strode along, warmed in the sub-zero temperatures by my ski pants and hiking boots, I happened to glance in the window of an art gallery from the street.I pressed my forehead against the cold glass and the paintings called me irresistibly closer. I pushed against the heavy door and beheld the glorious pre-exhibition canvasses leaning up against the walls, spread out in front of me, pulling me in.The gallery owner came out to meet me and as we spoke, I felt tears flowing down my cheeks. I can’t tell you that I was conscious of any pain. Neither was I aware of any other overwhelming emotion. Yet my cheeks were wet and the tears continued to flow. I asked about the opening and the dealer gave me the information and that I was welcome to attend the following Saturday and meet the artist.There was a painting of a woman in a bed; I could almost feel the warmth of the crumpled duvet and the feathers inside. The smell of musk and sweet sweat hung in the air as she smiled invitingly.The second painting that the dealer showed me, of a partly-shadowed homestead was undramatic, despite the light and dark contrasts but the warmth and humanity that permeated the motif was almost palpable.I don’t remember the other paintings. The dealer informed me that the bedroom painting would be a full-page spread in Politiken the next day; I could see why.Or rather, I couldn’t SEE why, I could only observe this lachrymous fluid gushing from my eyes without rhyme or reason; a strange and unknown (to me) artist having demonstrated the power he had over my emotions.If it had that effect on me, it probably had that effect on others too.See you at 14.00 on Saturday at Oxholm gallery on Pile Alle 25. I’m happy I got an invitation, that I don’t have to gatecrash this one, like I gatecrashed Rufus’s talk at Politiken Plus last week.Thank you for reading this far.If you liked this, you might also like:Sei pronto a colorare il camion dei pompieri di Leo il camion curioso?

I bambini elaborano un’idea complessa di costruzione che si intende realizzare e sfruttano tutte le proprie abilità per ottenere il risultato migliore.Le costruzioni sono, in un certo senso, “il”gioco per antonomasia, perché rappresentano il naturale istinto a ‘costruire’ e ‘distruggere’ dei bambini.

Attraverso il gioco il bambino impara a scoprire, a testare le sue teorie, a relazionarsi, ad esplorare cause ed effetti, a rispettare le regole della società e i valori della famiglia. Il bambino ogni giorno è alla scoperta del mondo e solo attraverso il gioco sarà in grado di scoprirlo e farne parte. Giocare aiuta a stimolare la creatività e l’immaginazione, insegnando al bambino ad allargare i suoi orizzonti e a sperimentare nuove potenzialità.Le costruzioni sono giocattoli che servono a soddisfare la voglia di ogni bambino di crescere, sperimentare e mettersi alla prova.
